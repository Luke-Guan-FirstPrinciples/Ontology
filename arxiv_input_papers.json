      "abstract": "  Text-to-image diffusion models allow seamless generation of personalized\nimages from scant reference photos. Yet, these tools, in the wrong hands, can\nfabricate misleading or harmful content, endangering individuals. To address\nthis problem, existing poisoning-based approaches perturb user images in an\nimperceptible way to render them \"unlearnable\" from malicious uses. We identify\ntwo limitations of these defending approaches: i) sub-optimal due to the\nhand-crafted heuristics for solving the intractable bilevel optimization and\nii) lack of robustness against simple data transformations like Gaussian\nfiltering. To solve these challenges, we propose MetaCloak, which solves the\nbi-level poisoning problem with a meta-learning framework with an additional\ntransformation sampling process to craft transferable and robust perturbation.\nSpecifically, we employ a pool of surrogate diffusion models to craft\ntransferable and model-agnostic perturbation. Furthermore, by incorporating an\nadditional transformation process, we design a simple denoising-error\nmaximization loss that is sufficient for causing transformation-robust semantic\ndistortion and degradation in a personalized generation. Extensive experiments\non the VGGFace2 and CelebA-HQ datasets show that MetaCloak outperforms existing\napproaches. Notably, MetaCloak can successfully fool online training services\nlike Replicate, in a black-box manner, demonstrating the effectiveness of\nMetaCloak in real-world scenarios.

      "abstract": "Recently, Video-Language Models (VideoLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, offering significant potential for flexible and powerful video query systems. These models typically rely on Vision Transformers (ViTs), which process video frames individually to extract visual embeddings. However, generating embeddings for large-scale videos requires ViT inferencing across numerous frames, posing a major hurdle to real-world deployment and necessitating solutions for integration into scalable video data management systems. This paper introduces D\\'ej\\`a Vu, a video-language query engine that accelerates ViT-based VideoLMs by reusing computations across consecutive frames. At its core is ReuseViT, a modified ViT model specifically designed for VideoLM tasks, which learns to detect inter-frame reuse opportunities, striking an effective balance between accuracy and reuse. Although ReuseViT significantly reduces computation, these savings do not directly translate into performance gains on GPUs. To overcome this, D\\'ej\\`a Vu integrates memory-compute joint compaction techniques that convert the FLOP savings into tangible performance gains. Evaluations on three VideoLM tasks show that D\\'ej\\`a Vu accelerates embedding generation by up to a 2.64x within a 2% error bound, dramatically enhancing the practicality of VideoLMs for large-scale video analytics."

The new model confirms our previous results obtained using\nthe integrated galaxy-wide IMF (IGIMF) theory: both variable IMF models\nreproduce the observed increase of $\\alpha$-enhancement as a function of\nstellar mass and the measured $z=0$ excess of dynamical mass-to-light ratios\nwith respect to photometric estimates assuming a universal IMF.

We\nfind that galaxies with small deviations (i.e. formally consistent with a\nuniversal IMF hypothesis) are characterized by more extended star formation\nhistories and live in less massive haloes with respect to the bulk of the\ngalaxy population. While the IGIMF theory does not change significantly the\nmean evolution of model galaxies with respect to the reference model, a\nCR-regulated IMF implies shorter star formation histories and higher peaks of\nstar formation for objects more massive than $10^{10.5} M_\\odot$.

      "abstract": "The search for signs of life in the Universe has entered a new phase with the advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Detecting biosignature gases via exoplanet atmosphere transmission spectroscopy is in principle within JWST's reach. We reflect on JWST's early results in the context of the potential search for biological activity on exoplanets. The results confront us with a complex reality. Established inverse methods to interpret observed spectra-already known to be highly averaged representations of intricate 3D atmospheric processes-can lead to disparate interpretations even with JWST's quality of data. Characterizing rocky or sub-Neptune-size exoplanets with JWST is an intricate task, and moves us away from the notion of finding a definitive \"silver bullet\" biosignature gas. Indeed, JWST results necessitate us to allow \"parallel interpretations\" that will perhaps not be resolved until the next generation of observatories. Nonetheless, with a handful of habitable-zone planet atmospheres accessible given the anticipated noise floor, JWST may continue to contribute to this journey by designating a planet as biosignature gas candidate. To do this we will need to sufficiently refine our inverse methods and physical models for confidently quantifying specific gas abundances and constraining the atmosphere context. Looking ahead, future telescopes and innovative observational strategies will be essential for the reliable detection of biosignature gases."

Although in the case of qubit systems, Bell measurements can be implemented using only linear optical components, the same result is no longer true for qudits, where at least the use of ancillary photons is required. In order to circumvent this limitation, one possibility is to introduce nonlinear effects. In this work, we adopt the latter approach and propose a scalable Bell measurement scheme for high-dimensional states, exploiting multiple squeezer devices applied to a linear optical circuit for discriminating the different Bell states. Our approach does not require ancillary photons, is not limited by the dimension of the quantum states, and is experimentally scalable, thus paving the way toward the realization of an effective high-dimensional Bell measurement."

      "abstract": "  Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning (ML) framework\nwhere multiple clients collaborate to train a model without exposing their\nprivate data. FL involves cycles of local computations and bi-directional\ncommunications between the clients and server. To bolster data security during\nthis process, FL algorithms frequently employ a differential privacy (DP)\nmechanism that introduces noise into each client's model updates before\nsharing. However, while enhancing privacy, the DP mechanism often hampers\nconvergence performance. In this paper, we posit that an optimal balance exists\nbetween the number of local steps and communication rounds, one that maximizes\nthe convergence performance within a given privacy budget. Specifically, we\npresent a proof for the optimal number of local steps and communication rounds\nthat enhance the convergence bounds of the DP version of the ScaffNew\nalgorithm. Our findings reveal a direct correlation between the optimal number\nof local steps, communication rounds, and a set of variables, e.g the DP\nprivacy budget and other problem parameters, specifically in the context of\nstrongly convex optimization. We furthermore provide empirical evidence to\nvalidate our theoretical findings.\n"

This rate is notably more\nfavorable than that of the traditional Monte Carlo (MC) methods, which is\n$O(m^{-1/2+\\varepsilon})$.

While\nmulticasting for systems operating at lower frequencies (i.e., sub-6GHz) has\nbeen extensively studied, they are sub-optimal for mmWave systems as mmWave has\nsignificantly different propagation characteristics, i.e., using the\ndirectional transmission to compensate for the high path loss and thus\npromoting spectrum sharing.

To demonstrate potential applications of\nthis dataset, we focus on the short-term employment disruptions related to\nhurricanes during 1990-2020. The observed county-level employment changes in\nthe initial month are small on average, though large employment losses (>30%)\ncan occur after extreme storms.

We present a broad theoretical framework that characterizes the logical operations resulting from these underlying automorphisms. In general, these logical operations can be performed by a combination of physical qubit permutations and a subsystem circuit. In special cases related to symmetries of the input Tanner graphs, logical operations can be performed solely through qubit permutations. We further demonstrate that these \"automorphism gadgets\" can possess inherent fault-tolerant properties such as effective distance preservation, assuming physical permutations are free. Finally, we survey the literature of classical linear codes with rich automorphism structures and show how various classical code families fit into our framework.

The primary aim of such predictive\nsystems is to use the high-dimensional data acquired from different sensors and\npredict the state-of-health of a particular component, e.g., brake pad. The\nclassical approach involves selecting a smaller set of relevant sensor signals\nusing feature selection and using them to train a machine learning algorithm.\nHowever, this fails to address two prominent problems: (1) sensors are\nsusceptible to failure when exposed to extreme conditions over a long periods\nof time; (2) sensors are electrical devices that can be affected by noise or\nelectrical interference. Using the failed and noisy sensor signals as inputs\nlargely reduce the prediction accuracy.

In this work, we propose\nan Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based framework to exploit the information\nfrom a large number of signals. Secondly, our framework introduces a data\naugmentation approach to perform accurate predictions in spite of noisy\nsignals.

The lack of quasi-toroidal solutions when\nstratification is close to neutral, except for the sectoral modes without nodes\nin radius, follows from the statement that the system needs to be in both\nhorizontal and radial force balance.

Future projections by Global Climate Models based on shared socioeconomic pathways from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) are widely used to understand the effects of climate change.

For example, there is a 1.5C root mean square error (RMSE) in the sea surface temperature (SST) projections of the climate model CNRM-CM6 compared to the Ocean Reanalysis System (ORAS5). We develop a suite of data-driven deep learning models for bias correction of climate model projections and apply it to correct SST projections of the Bay of Bengal. We propose the use of three different deep neural network architectures: convolutional encoder-decoder UNet, Bidirectional LSTM and ConvLSTM. We also use a baseline linear regression model and the Equi-Distant Cumulative Density Function (EDCDF) bias correction method for comparison and evaluating the impact of the new deep learning models. All bias correction models are trained using pairs of monthly CMIP6 projections and the corresponding month's ORAS5 as input and output. Historical data (1950-2014) and future projection data (2015-2020) of CNRM-CM6 are used for training and validation, including hyperparameter tuning. Testing is performed on future projection data from 2021 to 2024. Detailed analysis of the three deep neural models has been completed.

When misspecification is not severe, cutting\nfeedback can greatly increase posterior uncertainty without a large reduction\nof estimation bias, leading to a bias-variance trade-off.

For\ngraph-level tasks, we propose a subgraph backdoor attack independent of the\ngraph's topology. It dynamically selects trigger nodes for each target graph\nand modifies node features with constraints based on graph similarity, feature\nrange, and feature type. For node-level tasks, our attack begins with an\nanalysis of node features, followed by selecting and modifying trigger\nfeatures, which are then constrained by node similarity, feature range, and\nfeature type. Furthermore, an adaptive edge-pruning mechanism is designed to\nreduce the impact of neighbors on target nodes, ensuring a high attack success\nrate (ASR). Experimental results show that even with reasonable constraints for\nattack evasiveness, our attack achieves a high ASR while incurring a marginal\nclean accuracy drop (CAD).

      "abstract": "  Noisy labels are inevitable yet problematic in machine learning society. It\nruins the generalization of a classifier by making the classifier over-fitted\nto noisy labels. Existing methods on noisy label have focused on modifying the\nclassifier during the training procedure. It has two potential problems. First,\nthese methods are not applicable to a pre-trained classifier without further\naccess to training. Second, it is not easy to train a classifier and regularize\nall negative effects from noisy labels, simultaneously. We suggest a new branch\nof method, Noisy Prediction Calibration (NPC) in learning with noisy labels.\nThrough the introduction and estimation of a new type of transition matrix via\ngenerative model, NPC corrects the noisy prediction from the pre-trained\nclassifier to the true label as a post-processing scheme. We prove that NPC\ntheoretically aligns with the transition matrix based methods. Yet, NPC\nempirically provides more accurate pathway to estimate true label, even without\ninvolvement in classifier learning. Also, NPC is applicable to any classifier\ntrained with noisy label methods, if training instances and its predictions are\navailable. Our method, NPC, boosts the classification performances of all\nbaseline models on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The implemented code\nis available at https://github.com/BaeHeeSun/NPC.\n"

      "abstract": "  Recent proper motion studies of stars at the very center of the Galaxy\nstrongly suggest that Sagittarius (Sgr) A*, the compact nonthermal radio source\nat the Galactic Center, is a 2.5 million solar mass black hole. By means of\nnear-simultaneous multi-wavelength Very Long Baseline Array measurements, we\ndetermine for the first time the intrinsic size and shape of Sgr A* to be 72\nRsc by < 20 Rsc, with the major axis oriented essentially north-south, where\nRsc (= 7.5 x 10^{11} cm) is the Schwarzschild radius for a 2.5 million solar\nmass black hole. Contrary to previous expectation that the intrinsic structure\nof Sgr A* is observable only at wavelengths shorter than 1 mm, we can discern\nthe intrinsic source size at 7 mm because (1) the scattering size along the\nminor axis is half that along the major axis, and (2) the near simultaneous\nmulti-wavelength mapping of Sgr A* with the same interferometer makes it\npossible to extrapolate precisely the minor axis scattering angle at 7 mm. The\nintrinsic size and shape place direct constraints on the various emission\nmodels for Sgr A*. In particular, the advection dominated accretion flow model\nmay have to incorporate a radio jet in order to account for the structure of\nSgr A*.\n"

      "abstract": "  Non-semantic features or semantic-agnostic features, which are irrelevant to\nimage context but sensitive to image manipulations, are recognized as\nevidential to Image Manipulation Localization (IML). Since manual labels are\nimpossible, existing works rely on handcrafted methods to extract non-semantic\nfeatures. Handcrafted non-semantic features jeopardize IML model's\ngeneralization ability in unseen or complex scenarios. Therefore, for IML, the\nelephant in the room is: How to adaptively extract non-semantic features?\nNon-semantic features are context-irrelevant and manipulation-sensitive. That\nis, within an image, they are consistent across patches unless manipulation\noccurs. Then, spare and discrete interactions among image patches are\nsufficient for extracting non-semantic features. However, image semantics vary\ndrastically on different patches, requiring dense and continuous interactions\namong image patches for learning semantic representations. Hence, in this\npaper, we propose a Sparse Vision Transformer (SparseViT), which reformulates\nthe dense, global self-attention in ViT into a sparse, discrete manner. Such\nsparse self-attention breaks image semantics and forces SparseViT to adaptively\nextract non-semantic features for images. Besides, compared with existing IML\nmodels, the sparse self-attention mechanism largely reduced the model size (max\n80% in FLOPs), achieving stunning parameter efficiency and computation\nreduction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, without any handcrafted\nfeature extractors, SparseViT is superior in both generalization and efficiency\nacross benchmark datasets.\n"

The high sensitivity and large linear dynamic range of the maps in both\nisotopologues reveal a very complex, highly structured cloud morphology.

The 12CO emission shows a\nquite different structure, with particularly complex interfaces between regions\nof greater and smaller column density defining the boundaries of the\nlargest-scale cloud structures. The axes of the striations seen in the 12CO\nemission from relatively diffuse gas are aligned with the direction of the\nmagnetic field.

      "abstract": "Exposure-agnostic video frame interpolation (VFI) is a challenging task that aims to recover sharp, high-frame-rate videos from blurry, low-frame-rate inputs captured under unknown and dynamic exposure conditions. Event cameras are sensors with high temporal resolution, making them especially advantageous for this task. However, existing event-guided methods struggle to produce satisfactory results on severely low-frame-rate blurry videos due to the lack of temporal constraints. In this paper, we introduce a novel event-guided framework for exposure-agnostic VFI, addressing this limitation through two key components: a Target-adaptive Event Sampling (TES) and a Target-adaptive Importance Mapping (TIM). Specifically, TES samples events around the target timestamp and the unknown exposure time to better align them with the corresponding blurry frames. TIM then generates an importance map that considers the temporal proximity and spatial relevance of consecutive features to the target. Guided by this map, our framework adaptively blends consecutive features, allowing temporally aligned features to serve as the primary cues while spatially relevant ones offer complementary support. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in exposure-agnostic VFI scenarios."

Before entering the GW-driven regime, their evolution is driven\nby the interaction with the surrounding stars and gas. While stellar\ninteractions are found to always shrink the binary, recent studies predict the\npossibility of binary outspiral mediated by the presence of a gaseous disk,\nwhich could endlessly delay the coalescence and impact the merger rates of\nmassive binaries. Here we implement a semi-analytical treatment that follows\nthe binary evolution under the combined effect of stars and gas. We find that\nbinaries may outspiral only if they accrete near or above their Eddington limit\nand only until their separation reaches the gaseous disk self-gravitating\nradius. Even in case of an outspiral, the binary eventually reaches a large\nenough mass for GW to take over and drive it to coalescence.

It consists of two conditions that any system with a degenerate spectrum must fulfill in order to thermalize. The failure of each of them generates a different non-thermalizing scenario. One is due to the absence of chaos and may indicate that extra constants of motion are required to describe equilibrium states. The other one implies the existence of initial conditions evolving towards symmetry-breaking equilibrium states. If it spreads across an entire spectral region, then this region gives rise to a symmetry-breaking phase. We explore the applicability of this formalism by means of numerical experiments on a three-site Bose-Hubbard model with two non-commuting discrete symmetries."

Likewise higher-order cumulant ratios, $R_{31}^B$ and $R_{42}^B$, show no sign for the existence of a critical point in the parameter range explored with these cumulant ratios. A QCD critical point is unlikely to occur within the BES-II range in collider mode. Moreover, the results demonstrate that a non-interacting HRG description breaks down for $\\mu_B/T > 1$. We further analyze baryon-strangeness correlations normalized by strangeness fluctuations, finding consistency with STAR data at large beam energies but deviations at lower energies. Comparisons of electric-charge and strangeness correlations with STAR and ALICE data also show agreement at high energies, while the deviations at lower energies emphasize the role of unobserved strange resonances and the need for controlled feed-down corrections in baryon-strangeness correlations."

If this radio emission is bright enough, inhabited galaxies themselves form a cosmic population of artificial radio galaxies.

Measured radio source counts set limits on radio broadcasts across the radio spectrum, including the first Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) constraints at ~250 GHz. I compare these with commensal limits from background galaxies in the fields of large SETI surveys. The field limits are more powerful, but generally only over a limited luminosity range and for frequencies with dedicated SETI surveys. The limits are weaker when broadcasts clump into discrete hosts that are themselves extremely rare. I find that the abundance of Kardashev Type III radio broadcast populations is less than one in 10^17 stars, about one in a million large galaxies.

The one-component or $N_{\\rm OP} =1$ order\nparameter is one of the physical strains, and the Landau free energy has a\ntriple well, describing a first-order transition. We numerically study the\nevolution of the strain-strain correlation, and find that it exhibits dynamical\nscaling, with a coarsening length $L(t) \\sim t^{\\alpha}$. We find at\nintermediate and long times that the coarsening exponent sequentially takes on\nrespective values close to $\\alpha=2/3$ and $\\alpha=1/2$.

Furthermore, it has been empirically illustrated that the\nrelation between heavy tails and generalization might not always be monotonic\nin practice, contrary to the conclusions of existing theory. In this study, we\nestablish novel links between the tail behavior and generalization properties\nof stochastic gradient descent (SGD), through the lens of algorithmic\nstability. We consider a quadratic optimization problem and use a heavy-tailed\nstochastic differential equation (and its Euler discretization) as a proxy for\nmodeling the heavy-tailed behavior emerging in SGD. We then prove uniform\nstability bounds, which reveal the following outcomes: (i) Without making any\nexotic assumptions, we show that SGD will not be stable if the stability is\nmeasured with the squared-loss $x\\mapsto x^2$, whereas it in turn becomes\nstable if the stability is instead measured with a surrogate loss $x\\mapsto\n|x|^p$ with some $p<2$. (ii) Depending on the variance of the data, there\nexists a \\emph{`threshold of heavy-tailedness'} such that the generalization\nerror decreases as the tails become heavier, as long as the tails are lighter\nthan this threshold. This suggests that the relation between heavy tails and\ngeneralization is not globally monotonic.

Supermassive stars (SMSs) with masses of 1000 to 10000 M$_{\\odot}$ are promising candidates to explain these phenomena, but existing models have so far neglected the pivotal role of stellar rotation. Here, we present the first comprehensive evolutionary models of rotating Pop III SMSs computed using the GENEC stellar evolution code, including detailed treatments of rotation-induced chemical mixing, angular momentum transport, and mass loss driven by the $\\Omega\\Gamma$ limit. We demonstrate that rotation significantly enlarges the convective core and extends stellar lifetimes by up to 20%, with moderate enhancement of mass-loss rates as stars approach critical rotation thresholds. Our results further indicate that the cores of SMSs rotate relatively slowly (below $\\sim 200$ km s$^{-1}$), resulting in dimensionless spin parameters $a* < 0.1$ for intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) remnants that are notably lower than theoretical maximum spins. These findings highlight rotation as a key factor in determining the structural evolution, chemical yields, and black hole spin properties of SMSs, providing critical insights to interpret observational signatures from the high-redshift universe."

      "abstract": "  Ballistic transport occurs whenever electrons propagate without collisions\ndeflecting their trajectory. It is normally observed in conductors with a\nnegligible concentration of impurities, at low temperature, to avoid\nelectron-phonon scattering. Here, we use suspended bilayer graphene devices to\nreveal a new regime, in which ballistic transport is not limited by scattering\nwith phonons or impurities, but by electron-hole collisions. The phenomenon\nmanifests itself in a negative four-terminal resistance that becomes visible\nwhen the density of holes (electrons) is suppressed by gate-shifting the Fermi\nlevel in the conduction (valence) band, above the thermal energy. For smaller\ndensities transport is diffusive, and the measured conductivity is reproduced\nquantitatively, with no fitting parameters, by including electron-hole\nscattering as the only process causing velocity relaxation. Experiments on a\ntrilayer device show that the phenomenon is robust and that transport at charge\nneutrality is governed by the same physics. Our results provide a textbook\nillustration of a transport regime that had not been observed previously and\nclarify the nature of conduction through charge-neutral graphene under\nconditions in which carrier density inhomogeneity is immaterial. They also\ndemonstrate that transport can be limited by a fully electronic mechanism,\noriginating from the same microscopic processes that govern the physics of\nDirac-like plasmas.\n"

This electric field both decelerates the\nsupersonic ion flow and accelerates the electrons up to high velocities. In\nthis part of the transition region, the electric forces connected with the\ndeceleration of the ion flow strongly dominate over the Lorentz forces. We,\ntherefore, call this part the demagnetization region. In the second phase,\nLorentz forces due to convected magnetic fields compete with the electric\nfield, and the highly anisotropic and energetic electron distribution function\nis converted into a shell distribution with energetic shell electrons storing\nabout 3/4 of the upstream ion kinetic energy. In the third phase, the plasma\nparticles thermalize due to the relaxation of free energy by plasma\ninstabilities. The first part of the transition region opens up a new\nthermodynamic degree of freedom never before taken into account for the\nelectrons, since the electrons are usually considered to be enslaved to follow\nthe behavior of the protons in all velocity moments like density, bulk\nvelocity, and temperature.

During MOCVD, the\nCu-Ni alloy grains acted as a template for the growth of hexagonal boron\nnitride (hBN) while decaborane and ammonia were used as precursors for boron\nand nitrogen, respectively. Boron and nitrogen atoms diffused into the Cu-Ni\nsolution during the MOCVD process, precipitated out and grew along the Cu-Ni\ninterfaces upon cooling. It was demonstrated that pores were generated during\nthe sintering process and then filled by bulk hBN during the MOCVD process\n(indicated by energy dispersive spectroscopy) as the pores also served as\ncatalytic sites for the nucleation and growth of hBN.

It is known that for $q \\in \\{2, \\tfrac{k-1}{2}\\}$, these inequalities induce facets of the clique partitioning polytope if and only if $k$ is odd. Here, we characterize such facets for arbitrary $k$ and $q$. More specifically, we prove that the $q$-chorded $k$-cycle inequalities induce facets of the clique partitioning polytope if and only if two conditions are satisfied: $k = 1$ mod $q$, and if $k=3q+1$ then $q=3$ or $q$ is even. This establishes the existence of many facets induced by $q$-chorded $k$-cycle inequalities beyond those previously known."

Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has\nproven to be successful in this task. Typical T2I GANs are 2 phase methods that\nfirst pretrain an inter-modal representation from aligned image-text pairs and\nthen use GAN to train image generator on that basis. However, such\nrepresentation ignores the inner-modal semantic correspondence, e.g. the images\nwith same label. The semantic label in priory describes the inherent\ndistribution pattern with underlying cross-image relationships, which is\nsupplement to the text description for understanding the full characteristics\nof image. In this paper, we propose a framework leveraging both inter- and\ninner-modal correspondence by label guided supervised contrastive learning. We\nextend the T2I GANs to two parameter-sharing contrast branches in both\npretraining and generation phases. This integration effectively clusters the\nsemantically similar image-text pair representations, thereby fostering the\ngeneration of higher-quality images. We demonstrate our framework on four novel\nT2I GANs by both single-object dataset CUB and multi-object dataset COCO,\nachieving significant improvements in the Inception Score (IS) and Frechet\nInception Distance (FID) metrics of imagegeneration evaluation.

After preparing an initial\nquantum state with the first qubit, this quantum information is transferred and\nstored as a nonclassical photon state of the resonant cavity, then retrieved at\na later time by the second qubit connected to the opposite end of the cavity.\nBeyond simple communication, these results suggest that a high quality factor\nsuperconducting cavity could also function as a long term memory element.

We observe different line\nmorphologies, extended line emission on kpc scale, large [OIII]/H$\\alpha$\nscatter across the galaxies, and a radio-line alignment. In general, HEGs show\nmore prominent emission line properties than LEGs: larger, more disturbed, more\nluminous, and more massive regions of ionized gas with slightly larger covering\nfactors. We find evidence of correlations between line luminosities and (radio\nand X-ray) nuclear luminosities. All these results point to a main common\norigin, the active nucleus, which ionize the surrounding gas. However, the\ncontribution of additional photoionization mechanism (jet shocks and star\nformation) are needed to account for the different line properties of the two\nclasses. A relationship between the accretion, photoionization and feedback\nmodes emerges from this study. For LEGs (hot-gas accretors), the synchrotron\nemission from the jet represents the main source of ionizing photons. The lack\nof cold gas and star formation in their hosts accounts for the moderate\nionized-gas masses and sizes. For HEGs (cold-gas accretors), an ionizing\ncontinuum from a standard disk and shocks from the powerful jets are the main\nsources of photoionization, with the contribution from star formation.

In this followup study, we analyze the degree of confinement as the\nmagnetic field strength changes (controlled by varying the magnetic Prandtl\nnumber) in a coupled radiative zone (RZ) and convection zone (CZ) system. We\nbroadly find three solution regimes, corresponding to weak, medium, and strong\ndynamo magnetic field strengths. In the weak-field regime, the large-scale\nmagnetic field is mostly axisymmetric with regular, periodic polarity reversals\n(reminiscent of the observed solar cycle), but fails to create a confined\ntachocline. In the strong-field regime, the large-scale field is mostly\nnon-axisymmetric with irregular, quasi-periodic polarity reversals, and creates\na confined tachocline. In the medium-field regime, the large-scale field\nresembles a strong-field dynamo for extended intervals, but intermittently\nweakens to allow temporary epochs of strong differential rotation. In all\nregimes, the amplitude of poloidal field strength in the RZ is very well\nexplained by skin-depth arguments, wherein the oscillating field that gives\nrise to the skin depth (in the medium- and strong-field cases) is a\nnon-axisymmetric field structure rotating with respect to the RZ. These new\nsimulations reaffirm that tachocline confinement by the solar dynamo (the\nso-called fast magnetic confinement scenario) is possible, but suggest a new\npicture in which non-axisymmetric field components rotating with respect to the\nRZ play the primary role, instead of the regularly reversing axisymmetic field\nassociated with the 22-year cycle.\n"

In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive survey of hardware-backed key storage in Android devices. We analyze 490 119 Android apps, collecting data on how trusted hardware is used by app developers (if used at all) and cross-referencing our findings with sensitive user data collected by each app, as self-reported by developers via the Play Store's data safety labels.\n  We find that despite industry-wide initiatives to encourage adoption, 56.3% of apps self-reporting as processing sensitive user data do not use Android's trusted hardware capabilities at all, while just 5.03% of apps collecting some form of sensitive data use the strongest form of trusted hardware, a secure element distinct from the main processor. To better understand the potential downsides of using secure hardware, we conduct the first empirical analysis of trusted hardware performance in mobile devices, measuring the runtime of common cryptographic operations across both software- and hardware-backed keystores. We find that while hardware-backed key storage using a coprocessor is viable for most common cryptographic operations, secure elements capable of preventing more advanced attacks make performance infeasible for symmetric encryption with non-negligible payloads and any kind of asymmetric encryption."

EPIq features\nincludes: the adiabatic and non-adiabatic phonon dispersion, superconducting\nproperties (including the superconducting band gap in the Migdal-Eliashberg\nformulation), double-resonant Raman spectra and lifetime of excited carriers.\nThe possibility to customize most of its input makes EPIq a versatile and\ninteroperable tool. Particularly relevant is the interaction with the\nStochastic Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SSCHA) allowing anharmonic\neffects to be included in the calculation of electron-properties.

Different from datasets using primarily\nGaussian or Poisson distributions to synthesize noise in the sRGB domain, PVDD\nsynthesizes realistic noise from the RAW domain with a physically meaningful\nsensor noise model followed by ISP processing.

This model is motivated by the\nferroelectric orders in the multiferroic hexagonal manganites. At low\ntemperatures, trimerization of local atomic structures leads to six distinct\nbut energetically degenerate structural distortion, which can be modeled by a\nsix-state clock model. Moreover, the atomic displacements in the trimerized\nstate further produce a local electric polarization whose sign depends on\nwhether the clock variable is even or odd. These induced electric dipoles,\nwhich can be modeled by emergent Ising degrees of freedom, interact with each\nother via long-range dipolar interactions. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations\nare carried out to investigate low temperature phases resulting from the\ncompeting interactions. Upon lowering temperature, the system undergoes two\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions, characteristic of the\nstandard six-state clock model in two dimensions. The dipolar interaction\nbetween emergent Ising spins induces a first-order transition into a ground\nstate characterized by a three-fold degenerate stripe order. The intermediate\nphase between the discontinuous and the second BKT transition corresponds to a\nmaze-like hexagonal liquid with short-range stripe ordering.

This follows the six HIPASS galaxies searched in previous work\nand completes our full sample. In this paper we searched for absorption along\n17 sightlines with impact parameters between 6 and 46 kpc, making one new\ndetection. We also obtained simultaneous HI emission-line data, allowing us to\ndirectly relate the absorption-line detection rate to the HI distribution. From\nthis we find the majority of the non-detections in the current sample are\nbecause sightline does not intersect the HI disc of the galaxy at sufficiently\nhigh column density, but that source structure is also an important factor.\n  The detected absorption-line arises in the galaxy NGC 5156 ($z = 0.01$) at an\nimpact parameter of 19 kpc. The line is deep and narrow with an integrated\noptical depth of 0.82 km s$^{-1}$. High resolution Australia Telescope Compact\nArray (ATCA) images at 5 and 8 GHz reveal that the background source is\nresolved into two components with a separation of 2.6 arcsec (500 pc at the\nredshift of the galaxy), with the absorption likely occurring against a single\ncomponent.

We exploit the angular resolution and sensitivity of NIRCam to investigate the host galaxies of 31 quasars at $4\\lesssim z\\lesssim7$ drawn from multiple JWST surveys. Using a new multi-band forward-modeling code (\\textsc{GalfitS}) that incorporates physically motivated priors, we securely detect and quantify the host emission in 30 objects, while simultaneously characterizing the nuclear spectral energy distribution. The host galaxies of high-redshift quasars are $\\sim 0.3$~dex more compact than star-forming galaxies of comparable mass. A striking dichotomy emerges: luminous ``blue'' quasars ($L_{5100}\\gtrsim10^{45}\\,{\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}}$) reside in bulge-dominated galaxies ($n \\approx 5$) and exhibit a narrow range of ultraviolet nuclear slopes (median $\\beta_{\\rm UV} \\approx -1.4$), while fainter ``red'' quasars inhabit disk-like hosts ($n\\approx 1$) and display a broad range of slopes ($\\beta_{\\rm UV}\\approx-2$ to 4). These two populations differ markedly in their black hole-to-stellar mass ratios, with high-luminosity quasars showing $M_{\\mathrm{BH}}/M_\\ast = 1.2\\%$ compared to $4.7\\%$ for lower luminosity sources, placing them collectively $\\sim$0.6~dex above the local $M_{\\mathrm{BH}}-M_\\ast$ relation. This offset likely reflects rapid black hole growth in early gas-rich environments, where feedback from the active galactic nucleus becomes effective only after substantial gas depletion. Our findings suggest that the observed dichotomy, whether due to intrinsic spectral differences or dust extinction, fundamentally shapes the coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies in the early Universe."

In equilibrium, increasing the staggered potential in the Mott regime reduces the Mott gap and broadens the Hubbard bands, creating favorable conditions for impact ionization. After laser excitation, impact ionization is observed, with its occurrence depending on both the staggered potential and the laser pump frequency. By analyzing the time evolution of the kinetic, ionic, and Coulomb interaction energies, we identify a novel mechanism for impact ionization, in which excess ionic potential energy is converted into additional double occupancy-distinct from the conventional mechanism where excess kinetic energy drives this process. We further show that impact ionization arises from interference between excited states driven by photon excitation of the same order. These results present a new pathway for realizing impact ionization in strongly correlated electron systems."

Existing solutions, such as model fine-tuning and warping-based repainting, struggle with scalability, generalization, and robustness against artifacts. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free, inference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. 1) Intra-Step Recursive Refinement injects fine-grained trajectory guidance at denoising steps through a recursive correction loop, ensuring motion remains aligned with the target path. 2) Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages optical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space and selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels. 3) Dual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths to adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural signals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned guidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and photorealistic content generation. Our framework is plug-and-play and model-agnostic, enabling broad applicability across various 3D/4D tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in trajectory adherence, geometric consistency, and perceptual quality, outperforming both training-intensive and inference-only baselines."

Because both rates of grain refinement and of dynamic\nrecrystallization are proportional to the strain rate, it is suggested that\ntheir balance, which determines the steady state, is rate-independent.\n"

The components of these systems have temperatures between 6450 and 7500 K, masses between 1.4 and 1.85 solar masses, and radii between 1.49 and 3.05 solar radii. The residuals of these models were further analyzed using the Fourier method to reveal the pulsational frequencies of their oscillating components. Due to the similarity of the components of each system, the eclipses were used as spatial filters in order to determine which member is the pulsating star. CH Ind was found to pulsate in 46 frequencies; its primary component is a $\\gamma$ Dor star and the secondary a $\\delta$ Sct star. The primary component of V577 Oph oscillates in both the regimes of $\\gamma$ Dor and $\\delta$ Sct stars. Moreover, using past timings of minima, an eclipse timing variation analysis was also performed for V577 Oph, resulting in the calculation of the apsidal motion parameters and the existence of a third body around the system. Both components of CX Phe were found to be $\\delta$ Sct stars; its primary has three independent frequencies in the range of 14.5-17.4 d$^{-1}$ and its secondary has two main modes of 5.19 and 7.22 d$^{-1}$.

These approaches provide an opportunity to automatically generate\ntests; however, systematically creating valid and effective tests for AV\nsoftware remains a major challenge. To address this challenge, we introduce\nscenoRITA, a test generation approach for AVs that uses evolutionary algorithms\nwith (1) a novel gene representation that allows obstacles to be fully mutable,\nhence, resulting in more reported violations, (2) 5 test oracles to determine\nboth safety and motion sickness-inducing violations, and (3) a novel technique\nto identify and eliminate duplicate tests.

The general belief underlying its use is that increasing\nsearch depth improves play. Recent research has shown that given certain\nsimplifying assumptions about a game tree's structure, this belief is\nerroneous: searching deeper decreases the probability of making a correct move.\nThis phenomenon is called game tree pathology. Among these simplifying\nassumptions is uniform depth of win/loss (terminal) nodes, a condition which is\nnot true for most real games. Analytic studies in [10] have shown that if every\nnode in a pathological game tree is made terminal with probability exceeding a\ncertain threshold, the resulting tree is nonpathological. This paper considers\na new evaluation function which recognizes increasing densities of forced wins\nat deeper levels in the tree. This property raises two points that strengthen\nthe hypothesis that uniform win depth causes pathology. First, it proves\nmathematically that as search deepens, an evaluation function that does not\nexplicitly check for certain forced win patterns becomes decreasingly likely to\nforce wins. This failing predicts the pathological behavior of the original\nevaluation function. Second, it shows empirically that despite recognizing\nfewer mid-game wins than the theoretically predicted minimum, the new function\nis nonpathological.\n"

We find evidence for ionized outflows in 105\nregions from 103 galaxies, roughly 7% of all the Halpha-emitting galaxies\nidentified in this work. Our analysis allows us to study ionized outflows in\nindividual regions with SFRs down to ~0.01 Msun yr-1, extending the ranges\nprobed by previous works. The kinematics of the outflowing gas are strongly\nlinked to the type of ionization mechanism: regions characterized by LIER\nemission host outflows with more extreme kinematics (FWHM_broad ~900 km/s),\nfollowed by those originated in AGN (~550 km/s), `Intermediate' (~450 km/s) and\nSF (~350 km/s) regions.

We find a trend for higher outflow kinematics towards\nlarger stellar masses of the host galaxies but no significant variation as a\nfunction of star formation. The fraction of outflowing gas that can escape from\ngalaxies decreases towards higher dynamical masses, contributing to the\npreservation of the mass-metallicity relation by regulating the amount of\nmetals in galaxies. Finally, assuming that the extensions of the outflows are\nsignificantly larger than the individual star-forming regions, as found in\nprevious works, our results also support the presence of star formation within\nionized outflows, as recently reported by Maiolino et al. 2017 and Gallagher et\nal. 2019.\n"

Notably, the representation of complex\ncategorical features can help to alleviate cold-start issues in recommender\nsystems.\n"

The other is the variable\ncomponent from the inner region, in which the electrons are accelerated by the\nstochastic acceleration process. We use the time-dependent SSC model to produce\nthe emission from the variable component. We suggest that the flares are due to\nthe hardening of the electron spectrum under the process of the stochastic\nacceleration, which leads to the hardening of the observed spectrum in the\nX-ray and $\\gamma$-ray bands.

However, the inclusion of these additional features often degrades the performance of global predictive models trained on entire populations, despite improving individual household-level models. To address this challenge, we found that a hypernetwork architecture can effectively leverage external factors to enhance the accuracy of global electrical consumption forecasting models, by specifically adjusting the model weights to each consumer.\n  We collected a comprehensive dataset spanning two years, comprising consumption data from over 6000 luxembourgish households and corresponding external factors such as weather indicators, holidays, and major local events. By comparing various forecasting models, we demonstrate that a hypernetwork approach outperforms existing methods when associated to external factors, reducing forecasting errors and achieving the best accuracy while maintaining the benefits of a global model."

The size of\na planet's feeding zone in our simulations does not correlate with its final\nmass or semi-major axis, suggesting there is no systematic trend between a\nplanet's mass and its volatile inventory. Instead, we find that the feeding\nzone of any planet more massive than 0.1M_Earth is roughly proportional to the\nradial extent of the initial disk from which it formed: Delta\na~0.25(a_max-a_min), where a_min and a_max are the inner and outer edge of the\ninitial planetesimal disk. These wide stochastic feeding zones have significant\nconsequences for the origin of the Moon, since the canonical scenario predicts\nthe Moon should be primarily composed of material from Earth's last major\nimpactor (Theia), yet its isotopic composition is indistinguishable from Earth.\nIn particular, we find that the feeding zones of Theia analogs are\nsignificantly more stochastic than the planetary analogs.

In fact we\npredict that every planetary mass body should be expected to have a unique\nisotopic signature. In addition, we find paucities of massive Theia analogs and\nhigh velocity moon-forming collisions, two recently proposed explanations for\nthe Moon's isotopic composition.

This gave rise to\nextensive work in geometric deep learning, focusing on designing network\narchitectures that ensure neuron activations conform to regularity patterns\nwithin the input graph. However, in most cases the graph structure is only\naccounted for by considering the similarity of activations between adjacent\nnodes, which limits the capabilities of such methods to discriminate between\nnodes in a graph. Here, we propose to augment conventional GCNs with geometric\nscattering transforms and residual convolutions.

Although instruction tuning has proven to be a\ndata-efficient method for transforming LLMs into such generalist models, their\nperformance still lags behind specialist models trained exclusively for\nspecific tasks. In this paper, we investigate whether incorporating\nbroad-coverage generalist instruction tuning can contribute to building a\nspecialist model. We hypothesize that its efficacy depends on task specificity\nand skill requirements. Our experiments assess four target tasks with distinct\ncoverage levels, revealing that integrating generalist instruction tuning\nconsistently enhances model performance when the task coverage is broad. The\neffect is particularly pronounced when the amount of task-specific training\ndata is limited. Further investigation into three target tasks focusing on\ndifferent capabilities demonstrates that generalist instruction tuning improves\nunderstanding and reasoning abilities. However, for tasks requiring factual\nknowledge, generalist data containing hallucinatory information may negatively\naffect the model's performance. Overall, our work provides a systematic guide\nfor developing specialist models with general instruction tuning.

Accordingly, previously ignored systematic effects must be\naddressed. In this work, we evaluate the impact of the reduced shear\napproximation and magnification bias, on the information obtained from the\nangular power spectrum. To first-order, the statistics of reduced shear, a\ncombination of shear and convergence, are taken to be equal to those of shear.\nHowever, this approximation can induce a bias in the cosmological parameters\nthat can no longer be neglected. A separate bias arises from the statistics of\nshear being altered by the preferential selection of galaxies and the dilution\nof their surface densities, in high-magnification regions. The corrections for\nthese systematic effects take similar forms, allowing them to be treated\ntogether. We calculated the impact of neglecting these effects on the\ncosmological parameters that would be determined from Euclid, using cosmic\nshear tomography. To do so, we employed the Fisher matrix formalism, and\nincluded the impact of the super-sample covariance. We also demonstrate how the\nreduced shear correction can be calculated using a lognormal field forward\nmodelling approach. These effects cause significant biases in Omega_m, sigma_8,\nn_s, Omega_DE, w_0, and w_a of -0.53 sigma, 0.43 sigma, -0.34 sigma, 1.36\nsigma, -0.68 sigma, and 1.21 sigma, respectively. We then show that these\nlensing biases interact with another systematic: the intrinsic alignment of\ngalaxies. Accordingly, we develop the formalism for an intrinsic\nalignment-enhanced lensing bias correction. Applying this to Euclid, we find\nthat the additional terms introduced by this correction are sub-dominant.\n"

In our\napproach, we test bounded ontological distinctness for two particular\npreparations that are relevant in certain information processing tasks in that\nthey are associated with the even- and odd-parity of the bits to communicate.\nWhen there exists an ontological model where this distance is preserved we talk\nof parity preservation. Our main result provides a noise threshold under which\nviolating parity preservation (and so bounded ontological distinctness) agrees\nwith the established method for witnessing preparation contextuality in the\nsimplest nontrivial scenario. This is achieved by first relating the violation\nof parity preservation to the quantification of contextuality in terms of\ninaccessible information as developed in [Marvian, arXiv:2003.05984(2020)],\nthat we also show, given the way we quantify noise, to be more robust in\nwitnessing contextuality than Pusey's noncontextuality inequality. As an\napplication of our findings, we treat the case of two-bit parity-oblivious\nmultiplexing in the presence of noise. In particular, we provide a condition\nfor which the result establishing preparation contextuality as a resource for\nthe quantum advantage of the protocol in the noiseless case still holds in the\nnoisy case.\n"

      "abstract": "  We consider a multi-cell MIMO downlink (network MIMO) where $B$ base-stations\n(BS) with $M$ antennas connected to a central station (CS) serve $K$\nsingle-antenna user terminals (UT). Although many works have shown the\npotential benefits of network MIMO, the conclusion critically depends on the\nunderlying assumptions such as channel state information at transmitters (CSIT)\nand backhaul links. In this paper, by focusing on the impact of partial CSIT,\nwe propose an outage-efficient strategy. Namely, with side information of all\nUT's messages and local CSIT, each BS applies zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming in\na distributed manner. For a small number of UTs ($K\\leq M$), the ZF beamforming\ncreates $K$ parallel MISO channels. Based on the statistical knowledge of these\nparallel channels, the CS performs a robust power allocation that\nsimultaneously minimizes the outage probability of all UTs and achieves a\ndiversity gain of $B(M-K+1)$ per UT. With a large number of UTs ($K \\geq M$),\nwe propose a so-called distributed diversity scheduling (DDS) scheme to select\na subset of $\\Ks$ UTs with limited backhaul communication. It is proved that\nDDS achieves a diversity gain of $B\\frac{K}{\\Ks}(M-\\Ks+1)$, which scales\noptimally with the number of cooperative BSs $B$ as well as UTs. Numerical\nresults confirm that even under realistic assumptions such as partial CSIT and\nlimited backhaul communications, network MIMO can offer high data rates with a\nsufficient reliability to individual UTs.\n"

One explanation is that they arise from functional pressures\nto achieve efficient communication, a view which attributes cross-linguistic\nproperties to domain-general cognitive abilities. This hypothesis has\nsuccessfully addressed some syntactic universal properties such as\ncompositionality and Greenbergian word order universals. However, more abstract\nsyntactic universals have not been explored from the perspective of efficient\ncommunication. Among such universals, the most notable one is structure\ndependence, that is, the existence of grammar-internal operations that\ncrucially depend on hierarchical representations. This property has\ntraditionally been taken to be central to natural language and to involve\ndomain-specific knowledge irreducible to communicative efficiency.\n  In this paper, we challenge the conventional view by investigating whether\nstructure dependence realizes efficient communication, focusing on coordinate\nstructures. We design three types of artificial languages: (i) one with a\nstructure-dependent reduction operation, which is similar to natural language,\n(ii) one without any reduction operations, and (iii) one with a linear (rather\nthan structure-dependent) reduction operation. We quantify the communicative\nefficiency of these languages. The results demonstrate that the language with\nthe structure-dependent reduction operation is significantly more\ncommunicatively efficient than the counterfactual languages. This suggests that\nthe existence of structure-dependent properties can be explained from the\nperspective of efficient communication.\n"

This\npaper describes a novel geometrical approach to PCA in tree-space that\nconstructs the first principal path in an analogous way to standard linear\nEuclidean PCA. Given a data set of phylogenetic trees, a geodesic principal\npath is sought that maximizes the variance of the data under a form of\nprojection onto the path. Due to the high dimensionality of tree-space and the\nnonlinear nature of this problem, the computational complexity is potentially\nvery high, so approximate optimization algorithms are used to search for the\noptimal path.

The very existence of stars formed so early may serve as a\ntest for cosmological models with suppressed small-scale power (and, hence,\nlate formation of cosmic structure). We explore the ages of the oldest stars in\nnumerical simulations from the Cosmic Reionization On Computers (CROC) project\nwith cold dark matter (CDM) and two warm dark matter (WDM) cosmologies with 3\nand 6 keV particles.

In this paper, we propose a data agnostic filter\npruning method that uses an auxiliary network named Dagger module to induce\npruning and takes pretrained weights as input to learn the importance of each\nfilter. In addition, to help prune filters with certain FLOPs constraints, we\nleverage an explicit FLOPs-aware regularization to directly promote pruning\nfilters toward target FLOPs. Extensive experimental results on CIFAR-10 and\nImageNet datasets indicate our superiority to other state-of-the-art filter\npruning methods. For example, our 50\\% FLOPs ResNet-50 can achieve 76.1\\% Top-1\naccuracy on ImageNet dataset, surpassing many other filter pruning methods.\n"

This paper presents Monte\nCarlo calculations of the scintillation photon detection efficiencies of\noptical cavities using three current cryogenic photodetector technologies. In\norder of photon detection efficiency these are: (1) Ge/TES: germanium absorbers\nthat convert interacting photons to athermal phonons that are readout by\ntransition edge sensors, (2) KID: kinetic induction detectors that respond to\nthe breaking of cooper pairs by a change in resonance frequency, and (3) SNSPD:\nsuperconducting nanowire single photon detectors, where a photon briefly\ntransitions a thin wire from superconducting to normal. The detection\nefficiencies depend strongly on the n-type GaAs absolute absorption coefficient\nKA, which is a part of the narrow beam absorption that has never been directly\nmeasured. However, the high cryogenic scintillation luminosity of GaAs(Si,B)\nsets an upper limit on KA of 0.03/cm. Using that value and properties published\nfor Ge/TES, KID, and SNSPD photodetectors, this work calculates that those\nphotodetectors attached to opposing faces of a 1 cm3 cubic GaAs(Si,B) crystal\nin an optical cavity with gold mirrors would have scintillation photon\ndetection efficiencies of 35%, 25%, and 8%, respectively.

However, this has been clarified by recent high-energy\nx-ray studies which have shown that PZN is rhombohedral only in the skin while\nthe shape of the unit cell in the bulk is nearly cubic. In this study we have\nperformed both neutron elastic and inelastic scattering to show that the\ntemperature dependence of both the diffuse and phonon scattering in PZN and PMN\nis very similar. Both compounds show a nearly identical recovery of the soft\noptic mode and a broadening of the acoustic mode below $T_{c}$.

In contrast to PMN, we observe a broadening\nof the Bragg peaks in both the longitudinal and transverse directions below\n$T_{c}$. We reconcile this additional broadening, not observed in PMN, in terms\nof structural inhomogeneity in PZN.

      "abstract": "The relationship between the mass-loss history and final evolutionary stage of massive stars and the properties of the observable supernova (SN) is still under debate. This is especially true for stripped-envelope (Type Ib/c) SNe, where the progenitor ejects a considerably large amount of material during its evolution, which can lead to a circumstellar medium relatively close to the exploding star. Moreover, when the star explodes as a SN, this matter may contribute significantly to the generated luminosity because of the interaction. However, the trace of this circumstellar interaction can only be investigated for a couple of Type Ib/c SNe, and the nature of a close (within around $10^{15}$ cm) circumstellar matter (CSM) has also been largely unexplored for these objects.\n  Here, we present the results of our radio and bolometric light curve (LC) analysis related to SN 2004gq. We describe a combined model that explains the unusual LC properties of this event and supports the circumstellar interaction scenario. For that, we computed the quasi-bolometric LC of the SN and fit this with a multicomponent model to gain information on the progenitor and the surrounding circumstellar medium. We also analyzed the available radio LCs (taken at 1.4,\\ 4.9 and 8.5 GHz) of SN 2004gq to verify our estimated average mass-loss rate, which is one of the most crucial physical properties related to CSM models.\n  We infer reasonable parameters for SN 2004gq using radioactive decay and magnetar energy input. To power the entire LC, we must also add an extra energy source related to the CSM. We determine the most essential parameter of this medium: the average mass-loss rate from both LC and radio data fitting. We find that the suggested hidden circumstellar interaction is a viable mechanism that provides the required energy deficiency and that it can be estimated using a simple semi-analytic model."

Current medical reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) methods predominantly focus on close-ended VQA, thereby restricting the model's ability to engage in world knowledge retrieval and flexible task adaptation. More critically, these methods fall short of addressing the critical clinical demand for open-ended, reasoning-intensive decision-making. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{MedCCO}, the first multimodal reinforcement learning framework tailored for medical VQA that unifies close-ended and open-ended data within a curriculum-driven RFT paradigm. Specifically, MedCCO is initially fine-tuned on a diverse set of close-ended medical VQA tasks to establish domain-grounded reasoning capabilities, and is then progressively adapted to open-ended tasks to foster deeper knowledge enhancement and clinical interpretability. We validate MedCCO across eight challenging medical VQA benchmarks, spanning both close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results show that MedCCO consistently enhances performance and generalization, achieving a 11.4\\% accuracy gain across three in-domain tasks, and a 5.7\\% improvement on five out-of-domain benchmarks.

      "abstract": "  Physical layer security (PLS) has received a growing interest from the\nresearch community for its ability to safeguard data confidentiality without\nrelying on key distribution or encryption/decryption. However, the evolution\ntowards the 5G technology and beyond poses new security challenges that must be\naddressed in order to fulfill the unprecedented performance requirements of\nfuture wireless networks. Among the potential enabling technologies, RIS has\nattracted extensive attention due to its ability to proactively and\nintelligently reconfigure the wireless propagation environment to combat\ndynamic wireless channel impairments. Consequently, the RIS technology can be\nadopted to improve the information-theoretic security of both RF and OWC\nsystems. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the\ninformation-theoretic security of RIS-based RF and optical systems. The article\nfirst discusses the fundamental concepts of PLS and RIS technologies, followed\nby their combination in both RF and OWC systems. Subsequently, some\noptimization techniques are presented in the context of the underlying system\nmodel, followed by an assessment of the impact of RIS-assisted PLS through a\ncomprehensive performance analysis. Given that the computational complexity of\nfuture communication systems that adopt RIS-assisted PLS is likely to increase\nrapidly as the number of interactions between the users and infrastructure\ngrows, ML is seen as a promising approach to address this complexity issue\nwhile sustaining or improving the network performance. A discussion of recent\nresearch studies on RIS-assisted PLS-based systems embedded with ML is\npresented. Furthermore, some important open research challenges are proposed\nand discussed to provide insightful future research directions, with the aim of\nmoving a step closer towards the development and implementation of the\nforthcoming 6G wireless technology.\n"

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in language agents have led to significant improvements in multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle with handling open-domain problems, which require massive information retrieval due to their reliance on a fixed sequence of actions. To address this, we propose Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning (FGDIP), a novel framework tailored to enhance reasoning in LLMs by utilizing dynamic and adaptive strategies for information exploration in open-domain multi-hop reasoning tasks. Our approach begins by identifying key entities relevant to the problem, which serve as the initial nodes in the reasoning process. From these initial nodes, we then generate reasoning child nodes with the process being refined through a combination of historical error analysis and real-time feedback, which allows the framework to dynamically adjust and optimize its reasoning strategies. By integrating depth-first search with an innovative node generation technique, our framework adapts based on both prior error paths and concurrently generated nodes at the same hierarchical level. This dynamic strategy effectively expands the search space while ensuring the reasoning process systematically converges toward accurate solutions. Experimental results show that FGDIP achieved up to 54.47% F1 score on the HotpotQA dataset and 70.05% on the StrategyQA dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 5.03% and 7.25% respectively, highlighting its versatility and potential to enhance language agents in multi-hop reasoning tasks."

Here, we outline\nthe preliminary results for a model of quantum universe, in which gravity is\nfundamentally and by construction quantic. The model is based on three well\nmotivated assumptions with compelling observational and theoretical evidence:\nquantum mechanics is valid at all scales; quantum systems are described by\ntheir symmetries; universe has infinite independent degrees of freedom. The\nlast assumption means that the Hilbert space of the Universe has\n$SU(N\\rightarrow \\infty) \\cong \\text{area preserving Diff.} (S_2)$ symmetry,\nwhich is parameterized by two angular variables. We show that, in the absence\nof a background spacetime, this Universe is trivial and static. Nonetheless,\nquantum fluctuations break the symmetry and divide the Universe to subsystems.\nWhen a subsystem is singled out as reference -- observer -- and another as\nclock, two more continuous parameters arise, which can be interpreted as\ndistance and time. We identify the classical spacetime with parameter space of\nthe Hilbert space of the Universe. Therefore, its quantization is meaningless.\nIn this view, the Einstein equation presents the projection of quantum dynamics\nin the Hilbert space into its parameter space. Finite dimensional symmetries of\nelementary particles emerge as a consequence of symmetry breaking when the\nUniverse is divided to subsystems/particles, without having any implication for\nthe infinite dimensional symmetry and its associated interaction - perceived as\ngravity. This explains why gravity is a universal force.\n"

In this paper we\nshow that the accuracy can be improved significantly if the equation is\ntransformed before discretization, a process we call full operator\npreconditioning (FOP). It bears many similarities with traditional\npreconditioning for iterative methods but, crucially, transformations are\napplied at the operator level. We show that while condition-number improvements\nfrom traditional preconditioning generally do not improve the accuracy of the\nsolution, FOP can. A number of topics in numerical analysis can be interpreted\nas implicitly employing FOP; we highlight (i) Chebyshev interpolation in\npolynomial approximation, and (ii) Olver-Townsend's spectral method, both of\nwhich produce solutions of dramatically improved accuracy over a naive problem\nformulation.

      "abstract": "The safety validation of automatic emergency braking system (AEBS) requires accurately distinguishing between false positive (FP) and true positive (TP) system activations. While simulations allow straightforward differentiation by comparing scenarios with and without interventions, analyzing activations from open-loop resimulations - such as those from field operational testing (FOT) - is more complex. This complexity arises from scenario parameter uncertainty and the influence of driver interventions in the recorded data. Human labeling is frequently used to address these challenges, relying on subjective assessments of intervention necessity or situational criticality, potentially introducing biases and limitations. This work proposes a rule-based classification approach leveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle (PDP) to address those issues. Applied to a simplified AEBS, the proposed method reveals key strengths, limitations, and system requirements for effective implementation. The findings suggest that combining this approach with human labeling may enhance the transparency and consistency of classification, thereby improving the overall validation process. While the rule set for classification derived in this work adopts a conservative approach, the paper outlines future directions for refinement and broader applicability. Finally, this work highlights the potential of such methods to complement existing practices, paving the way for more reliable and reproducible AEBS validation frameworks."

The overlap ratio is a local observable which is concentrated at the top of the ranking and does not require the full ranking of all particles. It is simple to measure in practice. We derive an analytical formula for the average overlap ratio for a system of $N$ particles in the stationary state that undergo independent Brownian motion on the positive real half-axis with a reflecting wall at the origin and a drift towards the wall.

However, existing\nsocial robot navigation planners face two major challenges: managing real-time\nuser inputs and ensuring socially compliant behaviors in unfamiliar, zero-shot\nenvironments. In response, we introduce SALM, an interactive, human-in-loop\nSocially-Aware navigation Large Language Model framework that dynamically\nintegrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with large language model (LLM)\ncapabilities. SALM leverages contextual semantic understanding from real-time\nhuman-robot interactions to convert high-level user commands into precise,\nlow-level control actions. A high-level LLM module parses user input, guiding\nthe simultaneous generation of navigation commands by both a large language\nnavigation model (LNM) and a DRL-based navigation model (RLNM). A memory\nmechanism archives temporal data for continuous refinement, while a multi-step\ngraph-of-thoughts inference-based large language feedback model adaptively\nfuses the strengths of both planning approaches. Experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate that SALM not only enhances navigational precision in crowded,\ndynamic environments but also significantly improves system adaptability,\noffering tailored behaviors that align with individual user preferences and\nreal-time feedback.

Thus, the\nfabrication of an active layer with unique nanostructures is often used to\nenhance light absorption and general PSC efficiency. Using the theoretical\nsimulation based-on Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) technique, this work\ndemonstrates the successful improvement of light absorption by embedding\ncorrugated void-like structure and perovskite thickness modification. The\ninvestigation of a corrugated void-type anti-reflection layer effect on light\nabsorption is done by modifying the radius (r) and lattice constant (a) to\nobtain the optimum geometry.

The theoretical calculations show that the optimum\nr=692 nmand a=776 nm. Meanwhile, the optimum absorber layer thickness is 750\nnm.

Our\nkey idea is that agents should interpret such diverse language as a signal that\nhelps them predict the future: what they will observe, how the world will\nbehave, and which situations will be rewarded. This perspective unifies\nlanguage understanding with future prediction as a powerful self-supervised\nlearning objective.

In this paper we argue\nthat relativistic observers are subject to the same quantum illusions as in the\nEuclidean case: even though motion is discrete and respects no built-in 'arrow\nof time', observers have no choice but to perceive particle trajectories as\ncontinuous paths in spacetime.\n  Whereas the relativistic theories presuppose continuous paths as part of\ntheir axioms, the illusion of continuity allows us to replace this axiom with a\nlower-level quantum-inspired axiom concerning discrete jumps in spacetime. We\ninvestigate the nature of these jumps, and how far they can be tied to the\nunderlying geometric structure of spacetime. In particular, we consider hops\nwhich preserve features of the underlying number field, and investigate the\nextent to which all hops can be restricted to be of this form.\n  We conclude that hop-based motion can also be regarded as an illusion, one\ncaused by modelling physics in the 'wrong' number system.\n"

      "abstract": "  Solar Orbiter is the first space mission observing the solar plasma both in\nsitu and remotely, from a close distance, in and out of the ecliptic. The\nultimate goal is to understand how the Sun produces and controls the\nheliosphere, filling the Solar System and driving the planetary environments.\nWith six remote-sensing and four in-situ instrument suites, the coordination\nand planning of the operations are essential to address the following four\ntop-level science questions: (1) What drives the solar wind and where does the\ncoronal magnetic field originate? (2) How do solar transients drive\nheliospheric variability? (3) How do solar eruptions produce energetic particle\nradiation that fills the heliosphere? (4) How does the solar dynamo work and\ndrive connections between the Sun and the heliosphere? Maximising the mission's\nscience return requires considering the characteristics of each orbit,\nincluding the relative position of the spacecraft to Earth (affecting downlink\nrates), trajectory events (such as gravitational assist manoeuvres), and the\nphase of the solar activity cycle. Furthermore, since each orbit's science\ntelemetry will be downloaded over the course of the following orbit, science\noperations must be planned at mission level, rather than at the level of\nindividual orbits. It is important to explore the way in which those science\nquestions are translated into an actual plan of observations that fits into the\nmission, thus ensuring that no opportunities are missed. First, the overarching\ngoals are broken down into specific, answerable questions along with the\nrequired observations and the so-called Science Activity Plan (SAP) is\ndeveloped to achieve this. The SAP groups objectives that require similar\nobservations into Solar Orbiter Observing Plans (SOOPs), resulting in a\nstrategic, top-level view of the optimal opportunities for science observations\nduring the mission lifetime.\n"

The fluxes associated with\nthese three driving factors depend on the underlying kinematics, whose\ncharacteristics play key roles in determining particle segregation\nconfigurations. Unlike previous models for segregation, our model uses\nparameters based on kinematic measures from discrete element method simulations\ninstead of arbitrarily adjustable fitting parameters, and it achieves excellent\nquantitative agreement with both experimental and simulation results when\napplied to quasi-two-dimensional bounded heaps. The model yields two\ndimensionless control parameters, both of which are only functions of\nphysically control parameters (feed rate, particle sizes, and system size) and\nkinematic parameters (diffusion coefficient, flowing layer depth, and\npercolation velocity). The P\\'eclet number, $Pe$, captures the interplay of\nadvection and diffusion, and the second dimensionless parameter, $\\Lambda$,\ndescribes the interplay between segregation and advection. A parametric study\nof $\\Lambda$ and $Pe$ demonstrates how the particle segregation configuration\ndepends on the interplay of advection, segregation, and diffusion.

Unfortunately,\nexisting deep-learning-based algorithms, such as Neural Diving and\nPredict-and-search framework, are limited to generating only partial feasible\nsolutions, and they must rely on solvers like SCIP and Gurobi to complete the\nsolutions for a given IP problem. In this paper, we propose a novel framework\nthat generates complete feasible solutions end-to-end. Our framework leverages\ncontrastive learning to characterize the relationship between IP instances and\nsolutions, and learns latent embeddings for both IP instances and their\nsolutions.

However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world system with a non-ideal impulse response function."

      "categories": "cs.CV",
      "abstract": "  The text-guided video inpainting technique has significantly improved the\nperformance of content generation applications. A recent family for these\nimprovements uses diffusion models, which have become essential for achieving\nhigh-quality video inpainting results, yet they still face performance\nbottlenecks in temporal consistency and computational efficiency. This\nmotivates us to propose a new video inpainting framework using optical\nFlow-guided Efficient Diffusion (FloED) for higher video coherence.\nSpecifically, FloED employs a dual-branch architecture, where the time-agnostic\nflow branch restores corrupted flow first, and the multi-scale flow adapters\nprovide motion guidance to the main inpainting branch. Besides, a training-free\nlatent interpolation method is proposed to accelerate the multi-step denoising\nprocess using flow warping. With the flow attention cache mechanism, FLoED\nefficiently reduces the computational cost of incorporating optical flow.\nExtensive experiments on background restoration and object removal tasks show\nthat FloED outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods in both quality\nand efficiency. Our codes and models will be made publicly available.\n"

However, the role of human-like memory within these frameworks remains largely unexplored. Understanding how agents coordinate through memory is critical for natural language planning, where iterative reasoning, constraint tracking, and error correction drive the success. Inspired by working memory model in cognitive psychology, we present EvoMem, a multi-agent framework built on a dual-evolving memory mechanism. The framework consists of three agents (Constraint Extractor, Verifier, and Actor) and two memory modules: Constraint Memory (CMem), which evolves across queries by storing task-specific rules and constraints while remains fixed within a query, and Query-feedback Memory (QMem), which evolves within a query by accumulating feedback across iterations for solution refinement. Both memory modules are reset at the end of each query session. Evaluations on trip planning, meeting planning, and calendar scheduling show consistent performance improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of EvoMem. This success underscores the importance of memory in enhancing multi-agent planning."

By employing the qutrit-resonator\ndispersive interaction, we derive an effective Hamiltonian involving two-photon\nnumber operators and a coupler operator. This Hamiltonian can be used to\ndescribe a cross-Kerr nonlinearity interaction between two resonators when the\ncoupler is in the ground state. Because the coupler is unexcited during the\nentire process, the effect of coupler decoherence can be greatly minimized.\nMore importantly, compared with the previous proposals, our proposal does not\nrequire classical pulses. Furthermore, due to use of only a three-level qutrit,\nthe experimental setup is much simplified when compared with previous proposals\nrequiring a four-level artificial atomic systems. Based on our Hamiltonian, we\nimplement a two-resonator qubits controlled-phase gate and generate a\ntwo-resonator entangled coherent state.

Besides, landmark-based methods suffer from insufficient training data and annotations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel curvature angle estimation framework named CurvNet including latent contour representation based contour detection and iterative data engine based image self-generation. Specifically, we propose a parameterized spine contour representation in latent space, which enables eigen-spine decomposition and spine contour reconstruction. Latent contour coefficient regression is combined with anchor box classification to solve inaccurate predictions and mask connectivity issues. Moreover, we develop a data engine with image self-generation, automatic annotation, and automatic selection in an iterative manner. By our data engine, we generate a clean dataset named Spinal-AI2024 without privacy leaks, which is the largest released scoliosis X-ray dataset to our knowledge. Extensive experiments on public AASCE2019, our private Spinal2023, and our generated Spinal-AI2024 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art Cobb angle estimation performance.

We find that the distribution of ages is bimodal\nwith a strong peak at old ages and a secondary peak at young ages around ~\n2.5Gyr containing about 10 per cent of the objects. This is analogue to 'red\nsequence' and 'blue cloud' identified in galaxy populations usually containing\nboth early and late type galaxies.

All objects that host AGN\nin their centres without star formation are part of the red sequence\npopulation. We confirm and statistically strengthen earlier results that\nluminosity weighted ages, metallicities, and alpha/Fe element ratios of the red\nsequence population correlate well with velocity dispersion and galaxy mass.\nMost interestingly, however, these scaling relations are not sensitive to\nenvironmental densities and are only driven by galaxy mass. We infer that\nearly-type galaxy formation has undergone a phase transition a few billion\nyears ago around z~0.2. A self-regulated formation phase without environmental\ndependence has recently been superseded by a rejuvenation phase, in which the\nenvironment plays a decisive role possibly through galaxy interactions.\n"

      "abstract": "The emergence of cooperation in the groups of interacting agents is one of the most fascinating phenomena observed in many complex systems studied in social science and ecology, even in the situations where one would expect the agent to use a free-rider policy. This is especially surprising in the situation where no external mechanisms based on reputation or punishment are present. One of the possible explanations of this effect is the inhomogeneity of the various aspects of interactions, which can be used to clarify the seemingly paradoxical behavior. In this report we demonstrate that the diversity of interaction networks helps to some degree to explain the emergence of cooperation. We extend the model of spatial interaction diversity introduced in [L. Shang et al., Physica A, 593:126999 (2022)] by enabling the evaluation of the interaction groups. We show that the process of the reevaluation of the interaction group facilitates the emergence of cooperation. Furthermore, we also observe that a significant participation of agents switching their interaction neighborhoods has a negative impact on the formation of cooperation. The introduced scenario can help to understand the formation of cooperation in the systems where no additional mechanisms for controlling agents are included."

We firstly compute the\nstatistical expressions of the considered RIS-assisted FSO channels under weak\nand moderate-to-strong fading conditions.

Our results reveal that the proposed access network offers up to\naround 44% higher data rates and 240% wider coverage area for each FSO base\nstation (FSO-BS) compared to those of the relay-assisted one. The increase of\ncoverage area, on average, reduces 67% the number of required FSO-BSs for a\ngiven distance, which results in fewer handover processes compared to the\nalternative setups.

For a short-range impurity potential,\nbackscattering is dominated by the interference paths that do not encircle the\nnodal loop, yielding a 3D weak localization effect. In contrast, for a\nlong-range impurity potential, the electrons effectively diffuse in various 2D\nplanes and the backscattering is dominated by the interference paths that\nencircle the nodal loop. The latter, leads to weak antilocalization with a 2D\nscaling law.

Research suggests that maintaining trust among team members in a human-robot team is vital for successful team performance. Research suggests that trust is a multi-dimensional and latent entity that relates to past experiences and future actions in a complex manner. Employing a human-robot collaborative task, we design an optimal assistance-seeking strategy for the robot using a POMDP framework. In the task, the human supervises an autonomous mobile manipulator collecting objects in an environment. The supervisor's task is to ensure that the robot safely executes its task. The robot can either choose to attempt to collect the object or seek human assistance. The human supervisor actively monitors the robot's activities, offering assistance upon request, and intervening if they perceive the robot may fail. In this setting, human trust is the hidden state, and the primary objective is to optimize team performance. We execute two sets of human-robot interaction experiments. The data from the first experiment are used to estimate POMDP parameters, which are used to compute an optimal assistance-seeking policy evaluated in the second experiment. The estimated POMDP parameters reveal that, for most participants, human intervention is more probable when trust is low, particularly in high-complexity tasks. Our estimates suggest that the robot's action of asking for assistance in high-complexity tasks can positively impact human trust. Our experimental results show that the proposed trust-aware policy is better than an optimal trust-agnostic policy. By comparing model estimates of human trust, obtained using only behavioral data, with the collected self-reported trust values, we show that model estimates are isomorphic to self-reported responses."

By analyzing\ngravitational waves emitted during the ringdown phase of black holes under\ndifferent field perturbations, we explore the potential for detecting dark\nmatter. The model hypothesizes that the dark matter distribution around black\nhole is driven by a mechanism where dark energy endows gravitons with mass,\nthereby forming a new spacetime structure. Results reveal that as relevant\nparameters increase, the quasinormal modes (QNMs) exhibit a gradual reduction\nin real parts, with negative imaginary parts whose absolute values also\ndecrease. Moreover, compared to gravitational wave signals from Schwarzschild\nblack hole without dark matter, this system demonstrates significant\ndifferences in oscillation modes and frequencies. This achievement not only\nvalidates the self-consistency of the new gravitational model but also lays a\ntheoretical foundation for subsequent gravitational wave detection within dark\nmatter. Simultaneously, it provides new theoretical support for understanding\nthe mechanism of dark energy in large-scale cosmic structures and broadens the\nresearch perspective on the relationships between black hole physics, dark\nmatter, and dark energy.\n"

It has been shown that\nhierarchical GSFA (HGSFA) allows learning from images and other\nhigh-dimensional data. The feature space spanned by HGSFA is complex due to the\ncomposition of the nonlinearities of the nodes in the network.

To address these limitations, the research community has explored various approaches such as using local model parameters, federated generative adversarial learning, and federated representation learning. In our study, we propose a novel Clustered FedStack framework based on the previously published Stacked Federated Learning (FedStack) framework. The local clients send their model predictions and output layer weights to a server, which then builds a robust global model. This global model clusters the local clients based on their output layer weights using a clustering mechanism. We adopt three clustering mechanisms, namely K-Means, Agglomerative, and Gaussian Mixture Models, into the framework and evaluate their performance. We use Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) with the maximum likelihood function to determine the number of clusters. The Clustered FedStack models outperform baseline models with clustering mechanisms. To estimate the convergence of our proposed framework, we use Cyclical learning rates."

Contrasting integrated star formation rates (SFRs), we find that the slope\nand normalization of the star-forming main sequence in TNG50 are quantitatively\nconsistent with values derived by fitting observations from 3D-HST with the\nProspector Bayesian inference framework. The previous offsets of 0.2-1dex\nbetween observed and simulated main sequence normalizations are resolved when\nusing the updated masses and SFRs from Prospector. The scatter is generically\nsmaller in TNG50 than in 3D-HST for more massive galaxies with M_*>10^10Msun,\neven after accounting for observational uncertainties. When comparing resolved\nstar formation, we also find good agreement between TNG50 and 3D-HST: average\nspecific star formation rate (sSFR) radial profiles of galaxies at all masses\nand radii below, on, and above the SFMS are similar in both normalization and\nshape. Most noteworthy, massive galaxies with M_*>10^10.5Msun, which have\nfallen below the SFMS due to ongoing quenching, exhibit a clear central SFR\nsuppression, in both TNG50 and 3D-HST. In TNG this inside-out quenching is due\nto the supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback model operating at low accretion\nrates. In contrast, the original Illustris simulation, without this same\nphysical SMBH mechanism, does not reproduce the central SFR profile suppression\nseen in data. The observed sSFR profiles provide support for the TNG quenching\nmechanism and how it affects gas on kiloparsec scales in the centers of\ngalaxies.\n"

In the framework of remote sensing, such an assumption is\nno more valid in the presence of intra-class variabilities due to illumination\nconditions, weathering, slight variations of the pure materials, etc... In this\npaper, we first describe the results of investigations highlighting intra-class\nvariability measured in real images. Considering these results, a new\nformulation of the linear mixing model is presented leading to two new methods.\nUnconstrained Pixel-by-pixel NMF (UP-NMF) is a new blind source separation\nmethod based on the assumption of a linear mixing model, which can deal with\nintra-class variability. To overcome UP-NMF limitations an extended method is\nproposed, named Inertia-constrained Pixel-by-pixel NMF (IP-NMF). For each\nsensed spectrum, these extended versions of NMF extract a corresponding set of\nsource spectra. A constraint is set to limit the spreading of each source's\nestimates in IP-NMF. The methods are tested on a semi-synthetic data set built\nwith spectra extracted from a real hyperspectral image and then numerically\nmixed. We thus demonstrate the interest of our methods for realistic source\nvariabilities.

Motivated by this tension and drawing from bounded\nrationality, we introduce a dynamic model of candidate positioning based on a\nsimple behavioral heuristic: candidates imitate the policy of previous winners.\nThe resulting model is closely connected to evolutionary replicator dynamics\nand exhibits complex behavior, despite its simplicity. For\nuniformly-distributed voters, we prove that when there are $k = 2$, $3$, or $4$\ncandidates per election, any symmetric candidate distribution converges over\ntime to a concentration of candidates at the center. With $k \\ge 5$, however,\nwe prove that the candidate distribution does not converge to the center. For\ninitial distributions without any extreme candidates, we prove a stronger\nstatement than non-convergence, showing that the density in an interval around\nthe center goes to zero when $k \\ge 5$. As a matter of robustness, our\nconclusions are qualitatively unchanged if a small fraction of candidates are\nnot winner-copiers and are instead positioned uniformly at random. Beyond our\ntheoretical analysis, we illustrate our results in simulation; for five or more\ncandidates, we find a tendency towards the emergence of two clusters, a\nmechanism suggestive of Duverger's Law, the empirical finding that plurality\nleads to two-party systems. Our simulations also explore several variations of\nthe model, including non-uniform voter distributions and other forms of noise,\nwhich exhibit similar convergence patterns.

Based on these results, we develop practical algorithms,\nResidual Actor-Critic and Stackelberg Actor-Critic, for estimating the\ncorrection between AC and PG and use these to modify the standard AC algorithm.\nExperiments on popular tabular and continuous environments show the proposed\ncorrections can improve both the sample efficiency and final performance of\nexisting AC methods.\n"

      "abstract": "  For decades, mainframe systems have been vital in enterprise computing,\nsupporting essential applications across industries like banking, retail, and\nhealthcare. To harness these legacy applications and facilitate their reuse,\nthere is increasing interest in using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)\nto expose their data and functionalities, enabling the creation of new\napplications. However, identifying and exposing APIs for various business use\ncases presents significant challenges, including understanding legacy code,\nseparating dependent components, introducing new artifacts, and making changes\nwithout disrupting functionality or compromising key Service Level Agreements\n(SLAs) like Turnaround Time (TAT).\n  We address these challenges by proposing a novel framework for creating APIs\nfor legacy mainframe applications. Our approach involves identifying APIs by\ncompiling artifacts such as transactions, screens, control flow blocks,\ninter-microservice calls, business rules, and data accesses. We use static\nanalyses like liveness and reaching definitions to traverse the code and\nautomatically compute API signatures, which include request/response fields.\n  To evaluate our framework, we conducted a qualitative survey with nine\nmainframe developers, averaging 15 years of experience. This survey helped\nidentify candidate APIs and estimate development time for coding these APIs on\na public mainframe application, GENAPP, and two industry mainframe\napplications. The results showed that our framework effectively identified more\ncandidate APIs and reduced implementation time. The API signature computation\nis integrated into IBM Watsonx Code Assistant for Z Refactoring Assistant. We\nverified the correctness of the identified APIs by executing them on an IBM Z\nmainframe system, demonstrating the practical viability of our approach.\n"

In this\nwork, we propose a new approach based on capturing the spatial dependence of a\nlatent Gaussian process via a locally deformed Stochastic Partial Differential\nEquation (SPDE) with a buffer allowing for a different spatial structure across\nland and sea. The finite volume approximation of the SPDE, coupled with\nIntegrated Nested Laplace Approximation ensures feasible Bayesian inference for\ntens of millions of observations.

Within a\nseries of experiments, PUUPL yields substantial performance gains in highly\nimbalanced settings while also showing strong performance in balanced PU\nscenarios across recent baselines. We furthermore provide ablations and\nsensitivity analyses to shed light on PUUPL's several ingredients.

As a result, Bayesian methods, which treat model parameters\nas random variables and attempt to estimate their probability distributions\ngiven data, have become popular in systems biology. Bayesian parameter\nestimation often relies on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to sample\nmodel parameter distributions, but the slow convergence of MCMC sampling can be\na major bottleneck. One approach to improving performance is parallel tempering\n(PT), a physics-based method that uses swapping between multiple Markov chains\nrun in parallel at different temperatures to accelerate sampling.

      "abstract": "Maximizing the durability and reliability of offshore wind farms is essential for the clean energy transition. In this work, we demonstrate how wave energy converter (WEC) farms can shelter offshore wind farms from cyclic wave loading, resulting in significant reductions in turbine fatigue damage. Using experimentally validated hydrodynamic models, we show that WEC arrays can reduce wave-induced fatigue damage on the turbines by up to 25%, potentially lowering required monopile diameters and extending turbine lifetimes. This damage reduction propagates to the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of the wind farm, targeting cost reductions in nearly 50% of the total system costs. Additionally, WEC farms can benefit from this co-location by sharing siting costs, operation and maintenance teams, and mooring and transmission cables with the offshore wind farm. This work supports resilient, cost-effective offshore renewables for global deployment."

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect and estimate the end of the initial transient in time series data. Our method leverages the reversal mean standard error (RMSE) as a metric for assessing the stability of the data. Additionally, we employ fractional filtering techniques to enhance the detection accuracy by filtering out noise and capturing essential features of the underlying dynamics.\n  Combining with autocorrelation-corrected confidence intervals we provide a robust framework to automate transient detection and convergence assessment. The method ensures statistical rigor by accounting for autocorrelation effects, validated through simulations with varying time steps. Results demonstrate independence from numerical parameters (e.g., time step size, under-relaxation factors), offering a reliable tool for steady-state analysis. The framework is lightweight, generalizable, and mitigates inflated false positives in autocorrelated datasets."

      "abstract": "  We address the problem of computing the distribution of induced connected\nsubgraphs, aka \\emph{graphlets} or \\emph{motifs}, in large graphs. The current\nstate-of-the-art algorithms estimate the motif counts via uniform sampling, by\nleveraging the color coding technique by Alon, Yuster and Zwick. In this work\nwe extend the applicability of this approach, by introducing a set of\nalgorithmic optimizations and techniques that reduce the running time and space\nusage of color coding and improve the accuracy of the counts. To this end, we\nfirst show how to optimize color coding to efficiently build a compact table of\na representative subsample of all graphlets in the input graph. For $8$-node\nmotifs, we can build such a table in one hour for a graph with $65$M nodes and\n$1.8$B edges, which is $2000$ times larger than the state of the art. We then\nintroduce a novel adaptive sampling scheme that breaks the \"additive error\nbarrier\" of uniform sampling, guaranteeing multiplicative approximations\ninstead of just additive ones. This allows us to count not only the most\nfrequent motifs, but also extremely rare ones. For instance, on one graph we\naccurately count nearly $10.000$ distinct $8$-node motifs whose relative\nfrequency is so small that uniform sampling would literally take centuries to\nfind them. Our results show that color coding is still the most promising\napproach to scalable motif counting.\n"

      "abstract": "Although multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) terahertz (THz) continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) is theoretically secure, practical vulnerabilities may arise due to detector imperfections. This paper explores a CV measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD system operating at THz frequencies within a MIMO framework. In this system, measurement is delegated to an untrusted third party, Charlie, rather than the receiver, eliminating all detector attacks and significantly enhancing the system's practical security. Using transmit-receive beamforming techniques, the system transforms MIMO channels into multiple parallel lossy quantum channels, enabling robust key distribution between Alice and Bob. This study examines entanglement-based and prepare-and-measure protocols, deriving secret key rates for both asymptotic and finite code scenarios. Simulations reveal the critical role of multiple antenna configurations and efficient homodyne detection in mitigating free-space path loss and maximizing key rates. Results indicate that system performance is optimized at lower THz frequencies for long-range transmissions and higher frequencies for short-range applications. The proposed protocol offers a scalable solution for secure quantum communications in next-generation wireless networks, demonstrating potential for deployment in both indoor and outdoor environments."

Differential privacy is a privacy model for\nanonymization that offers more robust privacy guarantees than previous models,\nsuch as $k$-anonymity and its extensions. However, it is often disregarded that\nthe utility of differentially private outputs is quite limited, either because\nof the amount of noise that needs to be added to obtain them or because utility\nis only preserved for a restricted type and/or a limited number of queries. On\nthe contrary, $k$-anonymity-like data releases make no assumptions on the uses\nof the protected data and, thus, do not restrict the number and type of doable\nanalyses. Recently, some authors have proposed mechanisms to offer\ngeneral-purpose differentially private data releases.

Metabolism, in turn, relies on the delivery of metabolites and\nremoval of toxic byproducts through diffusion processes and the cerebral blood\nflow. A comprehensive mathematical model of brain metabolism should account not\nonly for the biochemical processes and the interaction of neurons and\nastrocytes, but also the diffusion of metabolites. In the present article, we\npresent a computational methodology based on a multidomain model of the brain\ntissue and a homogenization argument for the diffusion processes. In our\nspatially distributed compartment model, communication between compartments\noccur both through local transport fluxes, as is the case within local\nastrocyte-neuron complexes, and through diffusion of some substances in some of\nthe compartments. The model assumes that diffusion takes place in the\nextracellular space (ECS) and in the astrocyte compartment. In the astrocyte\ncompartment, the diffusion across the syncytium network is implemented as a\nfunction of gap junction strength. The diffusion process is implemented\nnumerically by means of a finite element method (FEM) based spatial\ndiscretization, and robust stiff solvers are used to time integrate the\nresulting large system.

In particular, some tools have been developed to cluster configurations from classical simulations with a standard focus on individual units, ranging from small molecules to complex proteins. Since the standard approach includes computing the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions, accounting for the permutation between atoms is crucial for optimizing the clustering procedure in the presence of identical molecules. To address this issue, we present the clusttraj program, a solvent-informed clustering package that fixes inflated RMSD values by finding the optimal pairing between configurations. The program combines reordering schemes with the Kabsch algorithm to minimize the RMSD of molecular configurations before running a hierarchical clustering protocol. By considering evaluation metrics, one can determine the ideal threshold in an automated fashion and compare the different linkage schemes available. The program capabilities are exemplified by considering solute-solvent systems ranging from pure water clusters to a solvated protein or a small solute in different solvents. As a result, we investigate the dependence on different parameters, such as the system size and reordering method, and also the representativeness of the cluster medoids for the characterization of optical properties. clusttraj is implemented as a Python library and can be employed to cluster generic ensembles of molecular configurations that go beyond solute-solvent systems."

Here we resolve this\napparent contradiction by introducing a model where a current flows in response\nto a magnetic field even without Weyl nodes. We point out that the previous\nderivation of a vanishing CME in the limit of vanishing real frequency is a\nconsequence of the assumption of periodic boundary conditions of the system. A\nmore realistic system with open boundary conditions is not subject to these\nconstraints and can have a non-vanishing CME. Consistent with recent work, we\nfound the finite frequency CME to be non-vanishing in general when there was a\nnon-vanishing Berry curvature on the Fermi surface. This does not necessitate\nhaving a topological Berry flux as in the case of a Weyl node. Finally, we\nstudy how the perturbation theory in magnetic field might be more stable in the\npresence of disorder. Using the standard diagrammatic treatment of disorder\nwithin the Born approximation, we have found that in a realistic disordered\nsystem, the chiral magnetic response is really a dynamical phenomena and\nvanishes in the DC limit.\n"

Aided by the NLFFF\nmodeling, we identify a double-decker flux rope configuration above the\npolarity inversion line (PIL) in the AR core region. The north ends of these\ntwo flux ropes were rooted in a negative- polarity magnetic patch, which began\nto move along the PIL and rotate anticlockwise before the X9.3 flare on\nSeptember 06. The strong shearing motion and rotation contributed to the\ndestabilization of the two magnetic flux ropes, of which the upper one\nsubsequently erupted upward due to the kink-instability. Then another two sets\nof twisted loop bundles beside these ropes were disturbed and successively\nerupted within 5 minutes like a chain reaction.

It has been applied to various networks such as wireless local area\nnetworks (WLANs), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Cognitive Radio Networks\n(CRNs), and Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks (CRSNs). The implementation of CB\nin CRSNs needs special attention as Primary Radio (PR) nodes traffic must be\nprotected from any harmful interference by Cognitive Radio (CR) nodes. On the\nother hand, CR nodes need to communicate without interruption to meet their\ndata rate requirements. If CR nodes perform frequent channel switching due to\nPR traffic then it will be difficult to meet their quality of service (QoS) and\ndata rate requirements. So, CR nodes need to select those channels which are\nstable. By stable, we mean those channels which cause less harmful interference\nto PR nodes and having less PR activity or long remaining idle time.

      "abstract": "Advancements in deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have positioned it as a promising approach for decision-making in cooperative games. However, it still remains challenging for MARL agents to learn cooperative strategies for some game environments. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent reasoning capabilities, making them promising candidates for enhancing coordination among the agents. However, due to the model size of LLMs, it can be expensive to frequently infer LLMs for actions that agents can take. In this work, we propose You Only LLM Once for MARL (YOLO-MARL), a novel framework that leverages the high-level task planning capabilities of LLMs to improve the policy learning process of multi-agents in cooperative games. Notably, for each game environment, YOLO-MARL only requires one time interaction with LLMs in the proposed strategy generation, state interpretation and planning function generation modules, before the MARL policy training process. This avoids the ongoing costs and computational time associated with frequent LLMs API calls during training. Moreover, trained decentralized policies based on normal-sized neural networks operate independently of the LLM. We evaluate our method across two different environments and demonstrate that YOLO-MARL outperforms traditional MARL algorithms."

Each of these feature sets provides a unique semantic\nperspective (or view) of apps' behaviours with inherent strengths and\nlimitations. Meaning, some views are more amenable to detect certain attacks\nbut may not be suitable to characterise several other attacks. Most of the\nexisting malware detection approaches use only one (or a selected few) of the\naforementioned feature sets which prevent them from detecting a vast majority\nof attacks. Addressing this limitation, we propose MKLDroid, a unified\nframework that systematically integrates multiple views of apps for performing\ncomprehensive malware detection and malicious code localisation. The rationale\nis that, while a malware app can disguise itself in some views, disguising in\nevery view while maintaining malicious intent will be much harder.\n  MKLDroid uses a graph kernel to capture structural and contextual information\nfrom apps' dependency graphs and identify malice code patterns in each view.\nSubsequently, it employs Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) to find a weighted\ncombination of the views which yields the best detection accuracy. Besides\nmulti-view learning, MKLDroid's unique and salient trait is its ability to\nlocate fine-grained malice code portions in dependency graphs (e.g.,\nmethods/classes). Through our large-scale experiments on several datasets\n(incl. wild apps), we demonstrate that MKLDroid outperforms three\nstate-of-the-art techniques consistently, in terms of accuracy while\nmaintaining comparable efficiency.

However, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual prompt engineering, failing to adapt and optimize based on diverse experimental experiences. Focusing on this, for the first time, we explore the paradigm of learning-based agentic ML, where an LLM agent learns through interactive experimentation on ML tasks using online reinforcement learning (RL). To realize this, we propose a novel agentic ML training framework with three key components: (1) exploration-enriched fine-tuning, which enables LLM agents to generate diverse actions for enhanced RL exploration; (2) step-wise RL, which enables training on a single action step, accelerating experience collection and improving training efficiency; (3) an agentic ML-specific reward module, which unifies varied ML feedback signals into consistent rewards for RL optimization. Leveraging this framework, we train ML-Agent, driven by a 7B-sized Qwen-2.5 LLM for autonomous ML. Remarkably, despite being trained on merely 9 ML tasks, our 7B-sized ML-Agent outperforms the 671B-sized DeepSeek-R1 agent. Furthermore, it achieves continuous performance improvements and demonstrates exceptional cross-task generalization capabilities."

We find that in a narrow vertically-periodic domain of aspect\nratio ten, the flow is dominated by the competition between three and four\nco-rotating rolls. We demonstrate that branches of three and four-roll\nequilibria are connected and can be understood in terms of their discrete\nsymmetries.

The physical appearance, disappearance, merging and splitting of\nrolls along the connecting branch provide a physical and phenomenological\nillustration of the equivariant theory of D3-D4 mode interaction.

Using our NuSTAR observation in this state, we found pulsations\nat the spin period, demonstrating that the X-ray emission is due to accretion\nof matter onto the neutron star surface. If the accretion geometry during this\nquasi-stable state is the same as during the cold-disk state, then matter\nindeed reaches the surface (as predicted) during this latter state. We discuss\nour results in the context of the cold-disk accretion model.\n"

The study of interacting galaxies as a function of\ntime (i.e. merger stage) has mostly been limited to high resolution merger\nsimulations, due to the poor time sampling available in cosmological\nsimulations. Building on an earlier study of galaxy pairs in the IllustrisTNG\ncosmological simulations, we reconstruct the orbits of galaxy pairs involving\nmassive galaxies ($M_* > 10^{10}M_{\\odot}$) at redshifts of $0 \\leq z < 1$,\nusing a novel kinematic interpolation scheme to model the orbits in between the\nIllustrisTNG snapshots (which are separated by 162 Myr on average). We assess\nthe accuracy of these interpolations using a pre-existing suite of merger\nsimulations, and find that kinematic interpolations provide a remarkable\nimprovement in accuracy compared with interpolations that use only radial\nseparations or 3D positions. We find that nearly 90 per cent of the closest\npairs ($r < 25$ kpc) have had a pericentre encounter within the past Gyr. Many\nof these close pairs are found on rapidly shrinking orbits, and roughly 85 per\ncent of these pairs will merge within 1 Gyr. However, approximately 3 per cent\nof these close pairs appear to be flyby systems that will never merge. These\nreconstructed orbits will be used in future studies to investigate how and when\ngalaxy properties change during close encounters and mergers between galaxies\nin IllustrisTNG.\n"

However, the fMRI-based image\nreconstruction methods are difficult to widely applied because of the\ncomplexity and high cost of the acquisition equipments. Considering the\nadvantages of low cost and easy portability of the electroencephalogram (EEG)\nacquisition equipments, we propose a novel image reconstruction method based on\nEEG signals in this paper. Firstly, to satisfy the high recognizability of\nvisual stimulus images in fast switching manner, we build a visual stimuli\nimage dataset, and obtain the EEG dataset by a corresponding EEG signals\ncollection experiment. Secondly, the deep visual representation model(DVRM)\nconsisting of a primary encoder and a subordinate decoder is proposed to\nreconstruct visual stimuli. The encoder is designed based on the\nresidual-in-residual dense blocks to learn the distribution characteristics\nbetween EEG signals and visual stimulus images, while the decoder is designed\nbased on the deep neural network to reconstruct the visual stimulus image from\nthe learned deep visual representation. The DVRM can fit the deep and multiview\nvisual features of human natural state and make the reconstructed images more\nprecise. Finally, we evaluate the DVRM in the quality of the generated images\non our EEG dataset. The results show that the DVRM have good performance in the\ntask of learning deep visual representation from EEG signals and generating\nreconstructed images that are realistic and highly resemble the original\nimages.\n"

LLMs have revived stance detection, but their online\ndeployment in online political discussions faces challenges like inconsistent\noutputs, biases, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We show how\nLLM-generated synthetic data can improve stance detection for online political\ndiscussions by using reliable traditional stance detection models for online\ndeployment, while leveraging the text generation capabilities of LLMs for\nsynthetic data generation in a secure offline environment. To achieve this, (i)\nwe generate synthetic data for specific debate questions by prompting a\nMistral-7B model and show that fine-tuning with the generated synthetic data\ncan substantially improve the performance of stance detection, while remaining\ninterpretable and aligned with real world data. (ii) Using the synthetic data\nas a reference, we can improve performance even further by identifying the most\ninformative samples in an unlabelled dataset, i.e., those samples which the\nstance detection model is most uncertain about and can benefit from the most.\nBy fine-tuning with both synthetic data and the most informative samples, we\nsurpass the performance of the baseline model that is fine-tuned on all true\nlabels, while labelling considerably less data.\n"

An electromagnetic resonator is used to probe the parity of the qubit-ensemble. The action of sequential measurements allows the nonclassicality of whole ensemble to manifest itself, in the ideal case, irrespective of its size. This enables to probe the macroscopic limits of quantum mechanics as the qubit-ensemble is, effectively, a single large spin of many $\\hbar$ units. Even as $\\hbar \\rightarrow 0$ in comparison to the total angular momentum of the ensemble, a constant amount of violation of MR is found in the noiseless case. However, environmental decoherence and inhomogeneity of qubit-electromagnetic field couplings precipitate the quantum-to-classical transition. This implies that Bohr's correspondence principle is not fundamental, but a consequence of practical limitations. We outline an implementation with a variety of qubits (superconducting qubits, spins in semiconductors, and Rydberg atoms) coupled to a coplanar waveguide resonator, and - via the corresponding noise analysis - find that violation of MR is detectable up to $100$ qubits via current technology."

We show that if the gamma rays observed from the Cygnus cocoon and\nWesterlund 1 are of hadronic origin, then the cosmic rays escaping the cluster\nat energies $\\gtrsim$ 10 TeV must cross a grammage inside the cluster that\nexceeds the Galactic grammage. At lower energies, depending on the model\nadopted to describe the production of gamma rays, such grammage may exceed or\nbe comparable with the grammage inferred from propagation on Galactic scales.\n  Methods. The flux of gamma rays is analytically computed for a few models of\ninjection of cosmic rays in star clusters, and compared with the flux measured\nfrom selected clusters.\n  Results. In all models considered here, comparing the inferred and observed\ngamma ray fluxes at $E\\gtrsim$ TeV, we conclude that CRs must traverse a large\ngrammage inside or around the cluster before escaping. Clearly these\nimplications would not apply to a scenario in which gamma rays are produced due\nto radiative losses of leptons in the cluster. Leptonic models typically\nrequire weaker magnetic fields, which in turn result in maximum energies of\naccelerated particles much below $\\sim$ PeV.\n  Conclusions. We conclude that if gamma ray emission in SCs is a generic\nphenomenon and if this radiation is due to hadronic interactions, either star\nclusters cannot contribute but a small fraction of the total cosmic ray flux at\nthe Earth, or their contribution to the grammage cannot be neglected and the\nparadigm of Galactic transport should be profoundly revisited.\n"

Among the proposed swampland criteria the distance conjecture is the\nmost well-motivated one from the universal behavior of string theory\ncompactifications. It claims that for a type of scalar fields, called moduli,\nthe effective field theory description will break down if it moves a large\ndistance in field (moduli) space.

Linear non-WKB wave transport\nequations are solved from the photosphere to 4 AU, and for wave periods ranging\nfrom 3 seconds to 3 days. We derive a radially varying power spectrum of\nkinetic and magnetic energy fluctuations for waves propagating in both\ndirections along a superradially expanding magnetic flux tube. This work\ndiffers from previous models in 3 major ways. (1) In the chromosphere and low\ncorona, the successive merging of flux tubes on granular and supergranular\nscales is described using a 2D magnetostatic model of a network element. Below\na critical merging height the waves are modeled as thin-tube kink modes, and we\nassume that all of the kink-mode wave energy is transformed into volume-filling\nAlfven waves above the merging height. (2) The frequency spectrum of horizontal\nmotions is specified only at the photosphere based on prior analyses of G-band\nbright point kinematics. Everywhere else the amplitudes of outward and inward\npropagating waves are computed with no free parameters. We find that the wave\namplitudes in the corona agree well with off-limb nonthermal line widths. (3)\nNonlinear turbulent damping is applied to the results of the linear model using\na phenomenological loss term. A single choice for the normalization of the\nturbulent outer-scale length produces both the right amount of damping at large\ndistances (to agree with in situ measurements) and the right amount of heating\nin the extended corona (to agree with empirical wind acceleration models). In\nthe corona, the modeled heating rate differs by more than an order of magnitude\nfrom a rate based on isotropic Kolmogorov turbulence.\n"

These two\napproaches are proven to yield the same reduced system. Moreover, by\nincorporating the vector field into the data ensemble, we provided several\nalgorithms for energy preservation. In a special case when the external force\nis described by the Rayleigh dissipative function, the proposed method\nautomatically preserves the dissipativity, boundedness, and stability of the\noriginal system.

Specifically, we introduce a versatile spectral modulation filter and derive the feature propagation rule of our model using fixed-point iteration. Unlike traditional defense mechanisms that rely on additional design elements to counteract attacks, the proposed graph filter provides a flexible-pass filtering approach, allowing it to selectively attenuate high-frequency components while preserving low-frequency structural information in the graph signal. By iteratively updating node representations, our model offers a flexible and efficient framework for preserving essential graph information while mitigating the impact of adversarial manipulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model through extensive experiments on various benchmark graph datasets, showcasing its resilience against adversarial attacks."

However, conventional LiDAR sensors perform dense, stateless scans, ignoring the strong temporal continuity in real-world scenes. This leads to substantial sensing redundancy and excessive power consumption, limiting their practicality on resource-constrained platforms. To address this inefficiency, we propose a predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning framework that anticipates informative regions of interest (ROI) based on past observations. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor network that distills historical spatial and temporal contexts into refined query embeddings. These embeddings guide a differentiable Mask Generator network, which leverages Gumbel-Softmax sampling to produce binary masks identifying critical ROIs for the upcoming frame. Our method significantly reduces unnecessary data acquisition by concentrating dense LiDAR scanning only within these ROIs and sparsely sampling elsewhere. Experiments on nuScenes and Lyft benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive scanning strategy reduces LiDAR energy consumption by over 65% while maintaining competitive or even superior 3D object detection performance compared to traditional LiDAR-camera fusion methods with dense LiDAR scanning."

The simplicity of the\nmodel allows us to inquire about several relevant microscopic quantities. The\ncontinuous 'active' torque on the central spin is propagated through nearest\nneighbour interactions with a uniform coupling parameter, J.

The site specific average\nrotational velocity of the spin, as one moves away from the central spin\nexhibits a nearly exponential decay with distance, allowing the definition of a\ncorrelation length $({\\xi})$ which grows rapidly with an increase of the\ncoupling (J) between the spins.

Findings show that participants preferred acting as curators, evaluating creative suggestions from the robot in a teacher or coach role.

Relativistic electrons\nand positrons traveling in interstellar space lose energy much more rapidly\nthan more massive particles such as protons and nuclei, with a rate that grows\nquadratically with the particle energy $E$. One therefore expects that the\neffects of energy loss should leave observable signatures in the $e^\\mp$\nspectra, in the form of softenings centered at the critical energy $E^*$. This\nquantity is determined by the condition that the total energy loss suffered by\nparticles during their residence time in the Galaxy is of the same order of the\ninitial energy. If the electrons and positrons are accelerated in discrete\n(quasi) point--like astrophysical objects, such as Supernova explosions or\nPulsars, the stochastic nature of the sources should also leave observable\nsignatures in the $e^\\mp$ energy spectra and angular distributions above a\nsecond (higher) critical energy $E^\\dagger$, determined by the condition that\nparticles with $E \\gtrsim E^\\dagger$ can propagate only for a maximum distance\nshorter than the average separation between sources. In this work we discuss\nthe theoretically expectations for the signatures of the energy loss effects on\nthe electron and positron spectra, and compare these predictions with the\nexisting observations. Recent measurements of the $(e^- + e^+$) flux have\ndiscovered the existence of a prominent spectral break at $E \\simeq 1$~TeV.\nThis spectral feature can perhaps be identified with the critical energy $E^*$.\nAn alternative hypothesis is to assmume that $E^*$ has a much lower value of\norder few GeV.

      "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider recommender systems with side information in the\nform of graphs. Existing collaborative filtering algorithms mainly utilize only\nimmediate neighborhood information and have a hard time taking advantage of\ndeeper neighborhoods beyond 1-2 hops. The main caveat of exploiting deeper\ngraph information is the rapidly growing time and space complexity when\nincorporating information from these neighborhoods. In this paper, we propose\nusing Graph DNA, a novel Deep Neighborhood Aware graph encoding algorithm, for\nexploiting deeper neighborhood information. DNA encoding computes approximate\ndeep neighborhood information in linear time using Bloom filters, a\nspace-efficient probabilistic data structure and results in a per-node encoding\nthat is logarithmic in the number of nodes in the graph. It can be used in\nconjunction with both feature-based and graph-regularization-based\ncollaborative filtering algorithms. Graph DNA has the advantages of being\nmemory and time efficient and providing additional regularization when compared\nto directly using higher order graph information. We conduct experiments on\nreal-world datasets, showing graph DNA can be easily used with 4 popular\ncollaborative filtering algorithms and consistently leads to a performance\nboost with little computational and memory overhead.\n"

J0526+5934 is an unresolved compact binary star with an orbital\nperiod of 20.5 minutes that belongs to this category. The visible component of\nJ0526+5934 has been recently claimed to be a hot sub-dwarf star with a CO white\ndwarf companion. Our aim is to provide strong observational plus theoretical\nevidence that the primary star is rather an extremely-low mass white dwarf,\nalthough the hot subdwarf nature cannot be completely ruled out. We analyse\noptical spectra together with time-series photometry of the visible component\nof J0526+5934 to constrain its orbital and stellar parameters. We also employ\nevolutionary sequences for low-mass white dwarfs to derive independent values\nof the primary mass. From the analysis of our observational data, we find a\nstellar mass for the primary star in J0526+5934 of 0.26+-0.05 Msun, which\nperfectly matches the 0.237+-0.035 Msun independent measurement we derived from\nthe theoretical evolutionary models. This value is considerably lower than the\ntheoretically expected and generally observed mass range of hot subdwarf stars,\nbut falls well within the mass limit values of extremely low-mass white dwarfs.\nWe conclude J0526+5934 is the fifth ultra-short period detached double white\ndwarf currently known.\n"

The main idea of recent fast ReID methods is the hashing algorithm,\nwhich learns compact binary codes and performs fast Hamming distance and\ncounting sort. However, a very long code is needed for high accuracy (e.g.\n2048), which compromises search speed. In this work, we introduce a new\nsolution for fast ReID by formulating a novel Coarse-to-Fine (CtF) hashing code\nsearch strategy, which complementarily uses short and long codes, achieving\nboth faster speed and better accuracy. It uses shorter codes to coarsely rank\nbroad matching similarities and longer codes to refine only a few top\ncandidates for more accurate instance ReID. Specifically, we design an\nAll-in-One (AiO) framework together with a Distance Threshold Optimization\n(DTO) algorithm. In AiO, we simultaneously learn and enhance multiple codes of\ndifferent lengths in a single model. It learns multiple codes in a pyramid\nstructure, and encourage shorter codes to mimic longer codes by\nself-distillation. DTO solves a complex threshold search problem by a simple\noptimization process, and the balance between accuracy and speed is easily\ncontrolled by a single parameter. It formulates the optimization target as a\n$F_{\\beta}$ score that can be optimised by Gaussian cumulative distribution\nfunctions.

By directly minimizing reprojected pixel errors, instead of\ngeometric reprojection errors, such methods can achieve sub-pixel alignment\naccuracy in both high and low textured regions. Typically, these problems are\nsolved using a forwards compositional Lucas-Kanade formulation parameterized by\n6-DoF rigid camera poses and a depth per point in the structure. For large\nproblems the most CPU-intensive component of the pipeline is the creation and\nfactorization of the Hessian matrix at each iteration. For many warps, the\ninverse compositional formulation can offer significant speed-ups since the\nHessian need only be inverted once. In this paper, we show that an ordinary\ninverse compositional formulation does not work for warps of this type of\nparameterization due to ill-conditioning of its partial derivatives.

The sponge was proved indifferentiable against classical adversaries by Bertoni et al. in 2008. Despite significant efforts in the years since, little is known about sponge security against quantum adversaries, even for simple properties like preimage or collision resistance beyond a single round. This is primarily due to the lack of a satisfactory quantum analog of the lazy sampling technique for permutations.\n  In this work, we develop a specialized technique that overcomes this barrier in the case of the sponge. We prove that the sponge is in fact indifferentiable from a random oracle against quantum adversaries. Our result establishes that the domain extension technique behind SHA-3 is secure in the post-quantum setting.

In this work, we use the deep neural network (DNN) DeepSpeech2, as a\nparadigm to investigate how natural input and cochlear implant-based inputs are\nprocessed over time. We generate naturalistic and cochlear implant-like inputs\nfrom spoken sentences and test the similarity of model performance to human\nperformance on analogous phoneme recognition tests. Our model reproduces error\npatterns in reaction time and phoneme confusion patterns under noise conditions\nin normal hearing and CI participant studies.

We find that dynamics over time in each layer\nare affected by context as well as input type. Dynamics of all phonemes diverge\nduring confusion and comprehension within the same time window, which is\ntemporally shifted backward in each layer of the network. There is a modulation\nof this signal during processing of CI which resembles changes in human EEG\nsignals in the auditory stream.

Here, we\nintegrate the Fokker-Planck equation of the cosmic ray (CR) electron and proton\ndistributions when post-processing cosmological simulations of cluster\nformation, and confront them with radio surface brightness and spectral data of\nComa. For standard assumptions, structure formation shocks lead to a seed\nelectron population which produces too centrally concentrated radio emission.\nMatching observations requires modifying properties of the CR population (rapid\nstreaming; enhanced CR electron acceleration at shocks) or turbulence\n(increasing turbulent-to-thermal energy density with radius), but at the\nexpense of fine-tuning. In a parameter study, we find that radio properties are\nexponentially sensitive to the amplitude of turbulence, which is inconsistent\nwith small scatter in scaling relations. This sensitivity is removed if we\nrelate the acceleration time to the turbulent dissipation time. In this case,\nturbulence above a threshold value provides a fixed amount of amplification;\nobservations could thus potentially constrain the unknown CR seed population.\nTo obtain sufficient acceleration, the turbulent magneto-hydrodynamics cascade\nhas to terminate by transit time damping on CRs, i.e., thermal particles must\nbe scattered by plasma instabilities.

We derive analytical expressions for the\nanisotropic collision frequencies using the Boltzmann equation in the\nrelaxation time approximation. The average parallel, perpendicular and Hall\nelectrical conductivities are computed in the high-temperature regime above\ncrustal melting, considering incoherent elastic electron-pasta scattering and\nrandomly oriented pasta structures.

Remarkably, the increased rate of biological mutations was\nfound not only within the epicenter area, but also along the trajectory of the\nTunguska Space Body (TSB). At that no traces of radioactivity were found, which\ncould be reliably associated with the Tunguska event. The main hypotheses about\nthe nature of the TSB, a stony asteroid, a comet nucleus or a carbonaceous\nchondrite, readily explain the absence of radioactivity but give no clues how\nto deal with the genetic anomaly. A choice between these hypotheses, as far as\nthe genetic anomaly is concerned, is like to the choice between ``blue devil,\ngreen devil and speckled devil'', to quote late Academician N.V.

Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms have been mathematically rewritten to reduce training time and increase accuracy in classification models. With the applied mathematical improvements, training time has been reduced by approximately 2 times for SVM on small datasets and by around 800 times on large datasets, and by approximately 4 times for Logistic Regression, compared to the scikit-learn implementation.

Starting from the exact path integral expression of the partition function, we introduce a time-dependent Gaussian approximation for the potential contribution and, then, invoke a principle of minimal sensitivity to minimize the error. This leads to a system of coupled nonlinear equations whose solution yields the optimal parameters of the gaussian approximation. The resulting approximate partition function accurately reproduces thermodynamic quantities such as the free energy, average energy, and specific heat -- even at zero temperature -- with typical errors of only a few percent. We illustrate the performance of our approximate formula with numerical results for systems of up to ten coupled anharmonic oscillators.

In general, small epsilon\nand small L are found to produce Gutenberg-Richter type power law statistics\nwith an exponential cutoff, while large epsilon and large L lead to a\ndistribution of small events combined with characteristic system-size events.\nIn a certain parameter regime the behavior is bistable, with transitions back\nand forth from one phase to the other on time scales determined by the fault\nsize and other model parameters.

Based on intuitions from special relativity\nand gauge theory, we introduce an operational notion of a quantum reference\nframe -- which is defined as a quantum system equipped with a covariant\npositive operator-valued measure (POVM) -- and build a framework on the concept\nof operational equivalence that allows us to enforce operationality by\nquotienting the quantum state spaces with equivalence relation of\nindistinguishability by the available effects, assumed to be invariant under\ngauge transformations, and framed in the sense of respecting the choice of the\nframe's POVM. Such effects are accessed via the yen construction, which maps\neffects on the system to those on the composite system, satisfying gauge\ninvariance and framing. They are called relative, and the classes of states\nindistinguishable by them are referred to as relative states. We show that when\nthe frame is localizable, meaning that it allows for states that give rise to a\nhighly localized probability distribution of the frame's observable, by\nrestricting the relative description upon such localized frame preparation we\nrecover the usual, non-relational formalism of quantum mechanics.

While mucus response is similar to water for l_1 indicating that\nprobes rarely contact the mucus mesh, for l_2 the response is distinctly more\nviscous and independent of probe size, demonstrating that the mucus behaves as\na continuum. However, this principally viscous mesoscale response is distinct\nfrom the largely elastic macroscopic mucus response. Only for l_3 does the\nresponse mimic macroscopic elasticity, with rigid constraints strongly\nresisting microsphere displacement.

      "abstract": "  The higher-order Stokes phenomenon can emerge in the asymptotic analysis of\nmany problems governed by singular perturbations. Indeed, over the last two\ndecades, the phenomena has appeared in many physical applications, from\nacoustic and optical wave phenomena and gravity-capillary ripples, to models of\ncrystal growth and equatorial Kelvin waves. It emerges in a generic fashion in\nthe exponential asymptotics of higher-order ordinary and partial differential\nequations. The intention of this work is to highlight its importance, and\ndevelop further practical methodologies for the study of higher-order Stokes\nphenomena, primarily for general non-integrable problems. Our formal\nmethodology is demonstrated through application to a second-order linear\ninhomogeneous ODE that exemplifies the simplest example of higher-order Stokes\nphenomena. In this model problem, the Borel transform can be derived\nexplicitly, and this gives insight into the beyond-all-orders structure. We\nreview and study additional examples, with physically-important connections,\nincluding higher-order ODEs and eigenvalue problems.\n"

      "abstract": "  One of the main predictions of general relativity is the existence of black\nholes featuring a horizon beyond which nothing can escape. Gravitational waves\nfrom the remnants of compact binary coalescences have the potential to probe\nnew physics close to the black hole horizons. This prospect is of particular\ninterest given several quantum-gravity models that predict the presence of\nhorizonless and singularity-free compact objects. The membrane paradigm is a\ngeneric framework that allows one to parametrise the interior of compact\nobjects in terms of the properties of a fictitious fluid located at the\nobject's radius. It has been used to derive the quasinormal mode spectrum of\nstatic horizonless compact objects. Extending the membrane paradigm to rotating\nobjects is crucial to constrain the properties of the spinning merger remnants.\nIn this work, we extend the membrane paradigm to linear order in spin and use\nit to analyse the relationships between the quasi-normal modes, the object's\nreflectivity, and the membrane parameters. We find a breaking of isospectrality\nbetween axial and polar modes when the object is partially reflecting or the\ncompactness differs from the black hole case. We also find that in reflective\nultracompact objects some of the modes tend towards instability as the spin\nincreases. Finally, we show that the spin enhances the deviations from the\nblack-hole quasinormal mode spectrum as the compactness decreases. This implies\nthat spinning horizonless compact objects may be more easily differentiated\nthan nonspinning ones in the prompt ringdown.\n"

In the near-term, however, the benefits of quantum machine\nlearning are not so clear. Understanding expressibility and trainability of\nquantum models-and quantum neural networks in particular-requires further\ninvestigation. In this work, we use tools from information geometry to define a\nnotion of expressibility for quantum and classical models. The effective\ndimension, which depends on the Fisher information, is used to prove a novel\ngeneralisation bound and establish a robust measure of expressibility. We show\nthat quantum neural networks are able to achieve a significantly better\neffective dimension than comparable classical neural networks. To then assess\nthe trainability of quantum models, we connect the Fisher information spectrum\nto barren plateaus, the problem of vanishing gradients. Importantly, certain\nquantum neural networks can show resilience to this phenomenon and train faster\nthan classical models due to their favourable optimisation landscapes, captured\nby a more evenly spread Fisher information spectrum. Our work is the first to\ndemonstrate that well-designed quantum neural networks offer an advantage over\nclassical neural networks through a higher effective dimension and faster\ntraining ability, which we verify on real quantum hardware.\n"

Plausible solutions to this problem are\nbased on an effective energy deposition into the central halo with an origin\nthat is either based on baryonic physics (e.g. supernova-driven gas blowouts;\nSNF) or on new DM physics (e.g. self-interacting DM, SIDM). We argue that the\nfundamental difference between the two is whether the process is impulsive or\nadiabatic, and explore novel ways to distinguishing them by looking at the\nresponse of stellar orbits. We perform idealised simulations of tracers\nembedded in a $1.48\\times 10^{10}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ spherical halo, and model the\ncreation of a $\\sim1$kpc DM matter core in SIDM with $\\sigma_T/m_{\\chi} =\n2\\,{\\rm cm}^2{\\rm g}^{-1}$ and through SNF by impulsively removing a mass\nequivalent to $\\mathcal{O}(10\\%)$ of the halo's potential energy. Choosing\nidealised initial orbital configurations for the tracers, we find that radial\nactions are conserved (changed) in the SIDM (impulsive) case. The adiabaticity\nof the SIDM case prevents tracers from changing their orbital family during\ncore formation whereas SNF separates tracers of initially the same family to a\nvariety of orbits. We show that these key features remain in a cosmological\nhalo, albeit for a few dynamical timescales. The number density and velocity\ndispersion profile of a Plummer sphere with $r_{1/2} = 500$ pc change only\nmarginally under adiabatic core formation, whereas SNF causes a substantial\nexpansion of the sphere driving it out of Jeans equilibrium.

The role of the static electric field is\nto induce electrostatic mixing of the rotational states of the water molecules.\nWe assume that the dimensions of the ion cluster are much shorter than the\nwavelength of the radiation in the resonant interaction. In this model, we\ndescribe rotating water molecules quantum mechanically by using a two-level\napproximation, and we show that the equations of motion of the system are the\nsame as those of a conventional free electron laser system. This result and the\nexistence of permanent electric polarization of the water molecules by\nelectrostatic mixing lead to a mechanism for radiation coherence induced by\ncollective instability in the wave-particle interaction.

The complete contextual information contains the location of the\ntarget as well as the state around the target. LCA uses the target state from\nthe previous frame to exclude the interference of similar objects and complex\nbackgrounds, thus accurately locating the target and enabling the tracker to\nobtain higher robustness and regression accuracy. By embedding the LCA module\nin Transformer, we build a powerful online tracker with a target-aware\nbackbone, termed as TATrack. In addition, we propose a dynamic online update\nalgorithm based on the classification confidence of historical information\nwithout additional calculation burden.

      "abstract": "Precipitation nowcasting, which aims to provide high spatio-temporal resolution precipitation forecasts by leveraging current radar observations, is a core task in regional weather forecasting. Recently, the cascaded architecture has emerged as the mainstream paradigm for deep learning-based precipitation nowcasting. This paradigm involves a deterministic model to predict posterior mean, followed by a probabilistic model to generate local stochasticity. However, existing methods commonly overlook the conflation of the systematic distribution shift in deterministic predictions and the local stochasticity. As a result, the distribution shift of the deterministic component contaminates the predictions of the probabilistic component, leading to inaccuracies in precipitation patterns and intensity, particularly over longer lead times. To address this issue, we introduce RectiCast, a two-stage framework that explicitly decouples the rectification of mean-field shift from the generation of local stochasticity via a dual Flow Matching model. In the first stage, a deterministic model generates the posterior mean. In the second stage, we introduce a Rectifier to explicitly learn the distribution shift and produce a rectified mean. Subsequently, a Generator focuses on modeling the local stochasticity conditioned on the rectified mean. Experiments on two radar datasets demonstrate that RectiCast achieves significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods."

Current Image Emotional Synthesis (IES) approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling. In this work, we introduce MUSE, the first unified framework capable of both emotional generation and editing. By adopting a strategy conceptually aligned with Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that widely used in both LLM and diffusion model communities, it avoids the requirement for additional updating diffusion model and specialized emotional synthesis datasets. More specifically, MUSE addresses three key questions in emotional synthesis: (1) HOW to stably guide synthesis by leveraging an off-the-shelf emotion classifier with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens; (2) WHEN to introduce emotional guidance by identifying the optimal timing using semantic similarity as a supervisory signal; and (3) WHICH emotion to guide synthesis through a multi-emotion loss that reduces interference from inherent and similar emotions. Experimental results show that MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between desired content, adherence to text prompts, and realistic emotional expression. It establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis."

Our goal is to enable users to\ncontrol video playback simply by their gestures in the air, without the need to\nuse a mouse or keyboard, especially when it is not convenient to do so.\nUltimately, we hope to expand our understanding of gesture-based interaction by\nunderstanding the inclusiveness of designing the hand as an interactive\ninterface, and further broaden the state of semantic gestures in an interactive\nenvironment through computational interaction methods.\n"

Existing knowledge graphs, with popular examples including\nDBpedia, YAGO and Wikidata, focus mostly on entity-centric information and are\ninsufficient in terms of their coverage and completeness with respect to events\nand temporal relations. In this article we address this limitation, formalise\nthe concept of a temporal knowledge graph and present its instantiation -\nEventKG. EventKG is a multilingual event-centric temporal knowledge graph that\nincorporates over 690 thousand events and over 2.3 million temporal relations\nobtained from several large-scale knowledge graphs and semi-structured sources\nand makes them available through a canonical RDF representation. Whereas\npopular entities often possess hundreds of relations within a temporal\nknowledge graph such as EventKG, generating a concise overview of the most\nimportant temporal relations for a given entity is a challenging task. In this\narticle we demonstrate an application of EventKG to biographical timeline\ngeneration, where we adopt a distant supervision method to identify relations\nmost relevant for an entity biography. Our evaluation results provide insights\non the characteristics of EventKG and demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed biographical timeline generation method.\n"

This is akin to the notion of\nasteroidal triple used in the classical characterization of interval graphs by\nLekkerkerker and Boland. We show that a circular-arc graph cannot have a\nblocking quadruple. We also observe that the absence of blocking quadruples is\nnot in general sufficient to guarantee that a graph is a circular-arc graph.\nNonetheless, it can be shown to be sufficient for some special classes of\ngraphs, such as those investigated by Bonomo et al. In this note, we focus on\nchordal graphs, and study the relationship between the structure of chordal\ngraphs and the presence/absence of blocking quadruples. Our contribution is\ntwo-fold. Firstly, we provide a forbidden induced subgraph characterization of\nchordal graphs without blocking quadruples. In particular, we observe that all\nthe forbidden subgraphs are variants of the subgraphs forbidden for interval\ngraphs. Secondly, we show that the absence of blocking quadruples is sufficient\nto guarantee that a chordal graph with no independent set of size five is a\ncircular-arc graph. In our proof we use a novel geometric approach,\nconstructing a circular-arc representation by traversing around a carefully\nchosen clique tree.\n"

      "abstract": "The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes applications such as medical (self-)diagnosis and preliminary triage raises significant ethical and practical concerns about the effectiveness, appropriateness, and possible harmfulness of the use of these technologies for health-related concerns and queries. Some prior work has considered the effectiveness of LLMs in answering expert-written health queries/prompts, questions from medical examination banks, or queries based on pre-existing clinical cases. Unfortunately, these existing studies completely ignore an in-the-wild evaluation of the effectiveness of LLMs in answering everyday health concerns and queries typically asked by general users, which corresponds to the more prevalent use case for LLMs. To address this research gap, this paper presents the findings from a university-level competition that leveraged a novel, crowdsourced approach for evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in answering everyday health queries. Over the course of a week, a total of 34 participants prompted four publicly accessible LLMs with 212 real (or imagined) health concerns, and the LLM generated responses were evaluated by a team of nine board-certified physicians. At a high level, our findings indicate that on average, 76% of the 212 LLM responses were deemed to be accurate by physicians. Further, with the help of medical professionals, we investigated whether RAG versions of these LLMs (powered with a comprehensive medical knowledge base) can improve the quality of responses generated by LLMs. Finally, we also derive qualitative insights to explain our quantitative findings by conducting interviews with seven medical professionals who were shown all the prompts in our competition. This paper aims to provide a more grounded understanding of how LLMs perform in real-world everyday health communication."

In recent\nyears great progress has been made by augmenting `traditional' network theory.\nHowever, existing network representations still lack crucial features in order\nto serve as a general data analysis tool. These include, most importantly, an\nexplicit association of information with possibly heterogeneous types of\nobjects and relations, and a conclusive representation of the properties of\ngroups of nodes as well as the interactions between such groups on different\nscales. In this paper, we introduce a collection of definitions resulting in a\nframework that, on the one hand, entails and unifies existing network\nrepresentations (e.g., network of networks, multilayer networks), and on the\nother hand, generalizes and extends them by incorporating the above features.\nTo implement these features, we first specify the nodes and edges of a finite\ngraph as sets of properties. Second, the mathematical concept of partition\nlattices is transferred to network theory in order to demonstrate how\npartitioning the node and edge set of a graph into supernodes and superedges\nallows to aggregate, compute and allocate information on and between arbitrary\ngroups of nodes. The derived partition lattice of a graph, which we denote by\ndeep graph, constitutes a concise, yet comprehensive representation that\nenables the expression and analysis of heterogeneous properties, relations and\ninteractions on all scales of a complex system in a self-contained manner.\nFurthermore, to be able to utilize existing network-based methods and models,\nwe derive different representations of multilayer networks from our framework\nand demonstrate the advantages of our representation.

Like past QAOA experiments, we study\nperformance for problems defined on the (planar) connectivity graph of our\nhardware; however, we also apply the QAOA to the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model\nand MaxCut, both high dimensional graph problems for which the QAOA requires\nsignificant compilation. Experimental scans of the QAOA energy landscape show\ngood agreement with theory across even the largest instances studied (23\nqubits) and we are able to perform variational optimization successfully. For\nproblems defined on our hardware graph we obtain an approximation ratio that is\nindependent of problem size and observe, for the first time, that performance\nincreases with circuit depth. For problems requiring compilation, performance\ndecreases with problem size but still provides an advantage over random\nguessing for circuits involving several thousand gates. This behavior\nhighlights the challenge of using near-term quantum computers to optimize\nproblems on graphs differing from hardware connectivity. As these graphs are\nmore representative of real world instances, our results advocate for more\nemphasis on such problems in the developing tradition of using the QAOA as a\nholistic, device-level benchmark of quantum processors.\n"

The system takes a population distribution as\ninput and generates mobility traces for a corresponding synthetic population.\n  Related generative approaches have not solved the challenges of capturing\nboth the patterns and variability in individuals' mobility behaviors over\nlonger time periods, while also balancing the generation of realistic data with\nprivacy. Our system leverages RNNs' ability to generate complex and novel\nsequences while retaining patterns from training data.

The workshop was divided\ninto three themes: resilience in cyber, cyber-physical, and socio-technical\nsystems. About 30 attendees in all participated in the discussions of cyber\nresilience. This article brings out the substantive parts of the challenges and\nsolution approaches that were identified in the cyber resilience theme. In this\narticle, we put forward the substantial challenges in cyber resilience in a few\nrepresentative application domains and outline foundational solutions to\naddress these challenges. These solutions fall into two broad themes:\nresilience-by-design and resilience-by-reaction. We use examples of autonomous\nsystems as the application drivers motivating cyber resilience. We focus on\nsome autonomous systems in the near horizon (autonomous ground and aerial\nvehicles) and also a little more distant (autonomous rescue and relief).\n  For resilience-by-design, we focus on design methods in software that are\nneeded for our cyber systems to be resilient. In contrast, for\nresilience-by-reaction, we discuss how to make systems resilient by responding,\nreconfiguring, or recovering at runtime when failures happen. We also discuss\nthe notion of adaptive execution to improve resilience, execution transparently\nand adaptively among available execution platforms (mobile/embedded, edge, and\ncloud). For each of the two themes, we survey the current state, and the\ndesired state and ways to get there. We conclude the paper by looking at the\nresearch challenges we will have to solve in the short and the mid-term to make\nthe vision of resilient autonomous systems a reality.\n"

Among many domain\ngeneralization methods, Fourier-transform-based domain generalization methods\nhave gained popularity primarily because they exploit the power of Fourier\ntransformation to capture essential patterns and regularities in the data,\nmaking the model more robust to domain shifts. The mainstream\nFourier-transform-based domain generalization swaps the Fourier amplitude\nspectrum while preserving the phase spectrum between the source and the target\nimages. However, it neglects background interference in the amplitude spectrum.\nTo overcome this limitation, we introduce a soft-thresholding function in the\nFourier domain. We apply this newly designed algorithm to retinal fundus image\nsegmentation, which is important for diagnosing ocular diseases but the neural\nnetwork's performance can degrade across different sources due to domain\nshifts. The proposed technique basically enhances fundus image augmentation by\neliminating small values in the Fourier domain and providing better\ngeneralization.

In particular, the photon pumping scenario has explicit\nexpectations for temporal variation in the strength of the excited lines, owing\nto the decline in the ionizing flux of the GRB afterglow. We analyze afterglow\nspectra of GRB 020813 obtained in two epochs of ~16 hours apart, and examine\ntransitions from the first excited state of Fe^+ at J=7/2 in these two sets of\ndata. We report a significant decline by at least a factor of five in the\nequivalent width of the FeII 2396 transition, the strongest from the J=7/2\nstate. We perform a Monte-Carlo analysis and determine that this temporal\nvariation is present at more than 3sigma level of significance.

      "categories": "cs.CV",
      "abstract": "Achieving high-fidelity 3D surface reconstruction while preserving fine details remains challenging, especially in the presence of materials with complex reflectance properties and without a dense-view setup. In this paper, we introduce a versatile framework that incorporates multi-view normal and optionally reflectance maps into radiance-based surface reconstruction. Our approach employs a pixel-wise joint re-parametrization of reflectance and surface normals, representing them as a vector of radiances under simulated, varying illumination. This formulation enables seamless incorporation into standard surface reconstruction pipelines, such as traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) frameworks or modern neural volume rendering (NVR) ones. Combined with the latter, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS) benchmark datasets, including DiLiGenT-MV, LUCES-MV and Skoltech3D. In particular, our method excels in reconstructing fine-grained details and handling challenging visibility conditions. The present paper is an extended version of the earlier conference paper by Brument et al. (in Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2024), featuring an accelerated and more robust algorithm as well as a broader empirical evaluation.

In present study, the\nelectrohydrodynamic (EHD), which is a popular active heat transfer enhancement\ntechnology, is introduced to enhance the PCM melting in a shell-tube LHTES\nsystem under microgravity. In our numerical simulations, we mainly focus on the\ncombined effects of the electric Rayleigh number $T$ and the eccentricity\n$\\Gamma$ on the melting performance under microgravity. Based on the numerical\nresults, it is found that in contrast to the case without the electric field,\nthe presence of the electric field causes the heat transfer efficiency and\nmelting behavior of LHTES system to be enhanced significantly. In addition, our\nresults indicates that the EHD technique always shows a good performance in\naccelerating the melting process even under microgravity, and specially, the\nmaximum time saving in some cases is more than $90\\%$. Furthermore, we note\nthat although the concentric annulus is always the optimal configuration under\nno-gravity condition, the optimal eccentric position of the internal tube\nstrongly depends on the electric Rayleigh number if the gravity effects are\ntaken into account.\n"

We define the\nneuron linkage in terms of two constraints: first, all neuron activations in\nthe linkage must have the same operating point. That is to say, all of them\nshare input weights. Secondly, a set of neurons is linked if and only if there\nis at least one member of the linkage that has a non-zero gradient in regard to\nthe input of the activation function. This means that for any input in the\nactivation function, there is at least one member of the linkage that operates\nin a non-flat and non-zero area. This simple change has profound implications\nin the network learning dynamics. In this article we explore the consequences\nof this proposal and show that by using this kind of units, internal covariate\nshift is implicitly solved. As a result of this, the use of linked neurons\nallows to train arbitrarily large networks without any architectural or\nalgorithmic trick, effectively removing the need of using re-normalization\nschemes such as Batch Normalization, which leads to halving the required\ntraining time. It also solves the problem of the need for standarized input\ndata.

We assert\nthat these claimed finite-time singularities are not genuine. Over the whole\nspace, the potential or the velocity coincides with singularities of harmonic\nfunctions. We show that the existence of the potential for unique velocity is\nnecessary but insufficient, as the velocity fields are merely specified up to\nmultiples of the curl of a vector potential, which satisfies a system of\ndegenerated Laplace's equations. We have derived several closed-form formulas\nin simply-connected domains, as well as orthogonal curvilinear co-ordinates. It\nfollows that steady solutions of Euler's equations are indeterminate. Hence,\nuse of singular potential flow in expounding fluid motions is inept. The\nformulation of the primitive variables (velocity and pressure) gives rise to\nnon-unique flow fields.

Key\nescrow aims to ensure that law enforcement agencies can access encrypted data\nwhen necessary, for example, in criminal investigations or national security\nmatters. However, key escrow also raises concerns about privacy and security.\nIf the trusted third party is compromised, the stored keys could be exposed,\nand unauthorized parties could access sensitive information. This could result\nin a significant breach of privacy and potentially harm national security. In\nidentity-based cryptography, the key escrow problem arises because a trusted\nthird party, the Private Key Generator (PKG), generates the private keys for\nall users. This means that the PKG has complete control over the private keys,\nwhich raises concerns about the security and privacy of the users. To balance\nsecurity and privacy concerns, some approaches have been proposed to address\nthe key escrow problem. We propose an efficient democratic identity-based\nencryption model that balances the government's and users' rights while\nensuring security and privacy. The key objective of the proposed scheme is to\nprovide the government with authority to monitor unlawful messages while\nensuring the user's privacy for their lawful messages. To achieve this, the\nscheme involves two entities: PKG and PKPO. The user's partial key is escrowed\nat PKG, while the partial key is stored at PKPO.

For R_beam >> R_A\nsoft X-ray emission from the hot interstellar medium surrounding the black hole\ndominates the observed emission while for R_beam << R_A hard X-ray emission\nfrom the accretion flow dominates. I apply these models to Chandra observations\nof the Galactic Center, for which R_beam ~ R_A. I argue that bremsstrahlung\nemission accounts for most of the ``quiescent'' (non-flaring) flux observed by\nChandra from Sgr A*; this emission is spatially extended on scales ~ R_A ~ 1''\nand has a relatively soft spectrum, as is observed. If accretion onto the\ncentral black hole proceeds via a Bondi or ADAF flow, a hard X-ray power law\nshould be present in deeper observations with a flux ~ 1/3 of the soft X-ray\nflux; nondetection of this hard X-ray component would argue against ADAF/Bondi\nmodels.

Specifically, we introduce two statistical distributions,termed the Mittag Leffler Bose Einstein (MLBE) and Mittag Leffler Fermi Dirac (MLFD) distributions, constructed by generalizing the conventional Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac distributions through the Mittag-Leffler function. This generalization incorporates a deformation parameter (\\alpha), which facilitates a continuous interpolation between bosonic and fermionic statistics, while inherently capturing nonequilibrium effects and generalized thermodynamic behavior. We analyze the thermodynamic geometry associated with these distributions and identify significant departures from standard statistical models. Notably, the MLBE distribution manifests a Bose-Einstein-like condensation even in the absence of interactions, whereas the MLFD distribution exhibits unconventional features, such as negative heat capacity in the low-temperature regime. These findings highlight the pivotal role of statistical deformation in determining emergent macroscopic thermodynamic phenomena."
