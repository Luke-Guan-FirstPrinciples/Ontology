Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when pairs of particles interact.
Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr debated the foundations of quantum mechanics at the Solvay Conference in 1927.
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that position and momentum cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision.
Erwin Schrödinger proposed a thought experiment involving a cat that is simultaneously alive and dead until observed.
Richard Feynman developed the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics at Cornell University.
Quantum superposition allows particles to exist in multiple states simultaneously until a measurement collapses the wave function.
The double-slit experiment demonstrates wave-particle duality, a fundamental concept in quantum physics.
Bell's theorem, proposed by John Stewart Bell in 1964, proves that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local hidden variable theories.
Quantum decoherence explains how quantum systems lose their coherence through interaction with the environment.
The Copenhagen interpretation, developed by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, remains the most widely taught interpretation of quantum mechanics.
Quantum tunneling enables particles to pass through potential barriers that would be insurmountable in classical physics.
Paul Dirac unified quantum mechanics and special relativity to create quantum electrodynamics.
The spin of an electron was discovered by George Uhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit in 1925.
Quantum computing uses qubits, which can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously through superposition.
Max Planck introduced the concept of energy quanta in 1900, marking the birth of quantum theory.
